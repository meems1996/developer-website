      "body": "Permissions for managing applications When you create an app, you'll likely want to share it. From New Relic One's Apps page, you can subscribe to apps you create, publish, and deploy, and to other publicly available apps. You must have the Nerdpack manager role to subcribe accounts to apps. Read on to learn about permissions and versions. Permissions for managing applications The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to available Nerdpacks. User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on. New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications, as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they’ve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog. Access apps in the entity explorer sidebar. Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization.",

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes.

Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Add, query, and mutate data using NerdStorage 45 min NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: cd / nr1 - how - to / use - nerdstorage; Copy Update the UUID and serve the application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User. For more information on the various NerdStorage components, please visit the New Relic developer website API documentation.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

This training will introduce you to the key concepts and walk you through developing New Relic Applications. The training is based on the self-paced material freely available on New Relic GitHub and delivered by a New Relic facilitator who will guide you through the introduction of the first 3 of the 10 labs available. This session allows for active questions and answers and facilitated troubleshooting when code or environments act unpredictably. Prerequisites This New Relic One training assumes no specific software engineering or developer experience; each lab comes with a fully completed functional solution that participants can copy into the lab repo to complete the activity. The labs are designed to promote experimentation by changing variables, layouts, data access methods, and UI components allowing each participant to comfortably experiment with the material to gain familiarity. Whether you are new to or rusty at programming or JavaScript, or happen to be an expert React.js developer; this training will provide important context to start you on the journey of developing New Relic Applications.  Must have: Permissions to install  Git installed Node installed A text editor or IDE of your choice (we will be using VS Code) Nerdpack manager role to deploy Technical exercises include exposure to the following technical topics: Installing the New Relic command-line interface (CLI) on local workstation Setting New Relic API developer access credentials Accessing GitHub repositories and cloning existing NR1 applications Executing New Relic CLI commands Making GraphQL and Web Service requests JavaScript layouts   During this session we will review the following topics: Installation of New Relic CLI and Environment setup Familiarisation with New Relic One Application component model and lifecycle Advanced UI construction and data processing Individual self paced experimentation and Open Source example deployment Request a Demo Related Links Case Study La plus grande brasserie au monde se tourne vers New Relic pour que la bière continue de couler à flots dans l’ère numérique Webinar Introduction to Custom Apps on New Relic One eBook Understanding the 3 Phases of DevOps Maturity Article Black Friday Is Coming: Are Your Sites and Apps Ready? eBook DevOps – so geht es richtig : Best Practices zur Überwindung von Erfolgshindernissen eBook DevOps Done Right: Best Practices to Knock Down Barriers to Success eBook Creating a Framework for Digital Media Success Article 7 Requirements for Monitoring Cloud Apps and Infrastructure COMPANY Careers and Culture Partner Program Investor Relations NewRelic.org Suppliers Portal CONNECT Contact Us Request Demo Events international newrelic.co.jp (日本語) newrelic.fr (Français) newrelic.de (Deutsch) newrelic.co.kr (한국어) Terms of Service DMCA Policy Privacy Policy Cookie Policy UK Slavery Act of 2015 ©2008-20 New Relic, Inc.

      "body": "Quickly tag a set of resources 5 min Tags help you group, search, filter, and focus the data about your entities, which can be anything from applications to hosts to services. Tagging entities using the New Relic CLI is a good candidate for automation. In this 5-minute guide, you use the New Relic CLI to add multiple tags to one of your entities. Before you begin For this guide you need your New Relic personal API Key: Create it at the Account settings screen for your account. Step 1 of 6 Install the New Relic CLI You can download the New Relic CLI via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 6 Create your New Relic CLI profile New Relic CLI profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Don't forget to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey API_KEY -r us # Set the profile as default newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 6 Search for an entity Your New Relic account might have hundreds of entities: Have a quick look by opening the Entity explorer. In the terminal, run entity search to retrieve a list of entities from your account as JSON. In the example, you're searching for all entities with \"test\" in their name. # Change the `name` to match any of your existing entities newrelic entity search --name \"test\" Copy Step 4 of 6 If there are matching entities in your account, the query yields data in JSON format, similar to this workload example. Select an entity from the results and look for its guid value; the guid is the unique identifier of the entity. Write it down. { \"accountId\": 123456789, \"domain\": \"NR1\", \"entityType\": \"WORKLOAD_ENTITY\", \"guid\": \"F7B7AE59FDED4204B846FB08423DB18E\", \"name\": \"Test workload\", \"reporting\": true, \"type\": \"WORKLOAD\" }, Copy Step 5 of 6 Add tags and tag lists to your entity With your entity guid, you can add tags right away. You can do so by invoking the entities tags create command. What if you want to add multiple tags? You can use tag sets for that: While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma-separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 Note Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: it could take a little while for the tags to get created. # Adding a single tag newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag key:value # Adding multiple tags newrelic entity tags create --guid GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Step 6 of 6 Check that the tags are there To make sure that the tags have been added to your entities, retrieve them using the entity tags get command. All tags associated with your entity are retrieved as a JSON array. newrelic entity tags get --guid GUID Tip Tags can be deleted at any time by invoking the entity tags delete command followed by the same arguments you used to create them. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Next steps Have a look at all the New Relic CLI commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create. If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic One entity explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

Command Description nr1 nerdpack:clone Clones a Nerdpack from a git repository. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serves your Nerdpack for testing and development purposes. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Shows or regenerates the UUID of a Nerdpack. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel. Command details nr1 nerdpack:clone Clone an existing Nerdpack Duplicates an existing Nerdpack onto your local computer. You can clone an open source Nerdpack from our Open Source GitHub repositories. After choosing a git repository, this command performs the following actions so that you can start using the Nerdpack: Clones the repository. Sets the repository as remote upstream. Installs all of its dependencies (using npm). Generates a new UUID using your profile, and commits it. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:clone OPTION Options -r, --repo=REPO Repository location (either an HTTPS or SSH path). (Required) -p, --path=PATH Determines the directory to clone to (defaults to the repository name). -f, --force Replaces destination folder if it exists. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:serve Serve your Nerdpack locally Launches a server with your Nerdpack locally on the New Relic One platform, where it can be tested live. To learn more about working with apps locally, see our guide on how to serve, publish, and deploy documentation. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:uuid Get your Nerdpack's UUID Prints the UUID (Universal Unique ID) of your Nerdpack, by default. The UUID determines what data the Nerdpack can access and who can subscribe to the Nerdpack. To deploy a Nerdpack you didn't make, you'll have to assign it a new UUID by using the -g or --generate option. For more details, see our GitHub workshop on GitHub. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:uuid Options --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. -f, --force If present, it will override the existing UUID without asking. -g, --generate Generates a new UUID if not available. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:publish Publish your Nerdpack Publishes your Nerdpack to New Relic. Please note: If no additional parameters are passed in, this command will automatically deploy the Nerdpack onto the DEV channel. If you want to specify your own list of deploy channels, add the --channel option. For example, $ nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel BETA --channel STABLE. If you want to disable this behavior, add -D or --skip-deploy to the command. Then, you can use nr1 nerdpack:deploy to perform a deploy manually. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Options -B, --skip-build Skips the previous build process. -D, --skip-deploy Skips the following deploy process. -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploys to. [default: STABLE] -f, --force Forces the publish, overriding any existing version in the registry. --dry-run Undergoes publishing process without actually publishing anything. --extra-metadata-path=extra-metadata-path Specifies a json file .path with extra metadata. [default: extra-metadata.json] --prerelease=STRING The value you enter will be appended to the current version of generated files. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:deploy Deploy your Nerdpack to a channel Deploys a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (DEV, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. For more on publishing and deploying, see Deploy to New Relic One. Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:deploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to deploy to. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --from-version=VERSION Specifies which version to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output. nr1 nerdpack:undeploy Undeploy your Nerdpack Undeploys a Nerdpack version from a specific channel (for example, DEV, BETA, or STABLE). Usage $ nr1 nerdpack:undeploy OPTION Options -c, --channel=DEV/BETA/STABLE Specifies the channel to undeploy from. (required) -i, --nerdpack-id=NERDPACK_ID Specifies the Nerdpack to deploy. By default, the command will use the one in package.json. --profile=PROFILE The authentication profile you want to use. --verbose Adds extra information to the output.",

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "Add, query, and mutate data using NerdStorage 45 min NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: cd / nr1 - how - to / use - nerdstorage; Copy Update the UUID and serve the application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button.

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from `nr1`; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors. Reload your app to see the pageview data on the map!",

      "body": "You can use alerts to set up notification channels, and attach those channels to policies. Your selected channels provide fast and consistent ways for the right personnel to be notified about incidents. For example, notifications allow you to include charts about the incident to provide context and share them with your team. Alerts offers several notification channels, including webhooks, Slack rooms, email, and more. You'll be notified by your notification channels when incidents are opened, acknowledged, or closed. This document explains the available notification channels and how to set them up. This document is about alerts notifications. For general information about unsubscribing from other New Relic emails, including marketing emails, weekly reports, and announcements, see Unsubscribe from New Relic emails. View notification channels To see all notification channels in your account: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. Add or remove notification channels To set up a new notification channel: On the Notification channels, click New notification channel. Select the type of channel and complete other required steps for it. To add or remove a notification policy or channel: Select a specific notification channel, select Alert policies, and add or remove a policy. OR Select a specific policy, select Notification channels, and add or remove a channel. Instructions for specific notification channels These are the available notification channel types. User For your convenience, we automatically load all users and their email addresses for the selected account. If your account has one or more sub-accounts, the notification channel includes only users for the currently selected master or sub-account. Use the User notification channel to select existing account team members and admins. To view the Users list or to add users to alert policies: Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Notification channels. A user channel also sends push notifications to any of the user's registered mobile devices. A device is registered if the user has logged into New Relic using the mobile app on the device. Email We automatically add every individual and their email address on the selected account to the User notification channel and you can select them there. You don't need to add existing New Relic accounts to the Email channel. To add an email channel for other users, follow these guidelines: Field Description Email (required) In general, use the Email notification channel to identify user emails or email aliases that are not already on the selected account. For example, if you have a dev-ops@company.com email alias for your DevOps team, add the email alias to the Email channel. Otherwise, use the User notification channel to select specific users on your DevOps team. For easier maintenance, add a single non-user email address or alias to a single alert notification channel. If you want to use the email channel for more than one email, create an email group or alias outside your account. These email addresses can be the same as or different from email addresses already on your account. Users can unsubscribe from general (non-alerts-related) emails, but they cannot unsubscribe from alerts email notifications. Instead, the account Owner, Admin, or add-on manager must remove users from the policy's email notification channel. Include JSON attachment (optional) To include a JSON attachment with the email notification, select this checkbox. OpsGenie You must have an existing OpsGenie account integrated with New Relic in order to provide the following information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the OpsGenie notification channel (maximum 64 characters). API key (required) The API key generated from your OpsGenie integration used to authenticate API requests. Teams (optional) List of team names that are responsible for the alert. OpsGenie runs team escalation policies to calculate which users will receive notifications. Tags (optional) A comma-separated list of labels attached to the alert. To overwrite the OpsGenie Quiet Hours setting for urgent alerts, add an OverwriteQuietHours tag. Recipients (optional) One or more names of users, groups, on-call schedules, escalation policies, etc., that OpsGenie uses to calculate where to send notifications. PagerDuty You must have an existing PagerDuty account in order to provide the following information: Field Description Service name (required) The name of your service integrating with PagerDuty for notifications. Integration key (required) The unique service identifier used by PagerDuty's Integration API to trigger, acknowledge, and resolve incidents for the service. Slack Before adding Slack notifications, you must create a unique webhook integration using Slack's New Relic integration. If you want web, transaction, server, and mobile alerts to be posted in separate channels, you must set up separate integrations for each one. Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the Slack notification channel (maximum 64 characters); for example, Network Ops Center. URL (required) Copy and paste the New Relic webhook integration URL that you've set up with Slack. For example: https://hooks.slack.com/services/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 Be sure to include https:// in the URL. Do not use http://. Team channel (optional) If used, include # before the name of the Slack channel where alert notifications are sent; for example, #NOC. VictorOps You must have an existing VictorOps account in order to provide the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for this notification channel (maximum 64 characters). For example, if the VictorOps Route key is for your Technical Support team, you could name this channel Tech Support - VictorOps. Key (required) VictorOps generates a unique key for each account. It maps the VictorOps account to its associated integrations. Route key (optional) This key maps the alert or incident to a specific team. Webhook Webhooks are HTTP POST messages containing JSON documents delivered to a destination URL. When an incident is opened, acknowledged, or closed, our webhook feature sends a message to your URL with any relevant information, such as a description of the event and a link back to New Relic. You also have the option to customize the payload in the POST message for further integration into your system. If your endpoint does not acknowledge the POST request within 10 seconds, the Alerts UI may indicate a failed notification event for the related incident. Before adding webhook notifications, you must have an endpoint set up to respond with a status code between 200 and 206 after receiving the following required information: Field Description Channel name (required) A meaningful name for the webhook (maximum 64 characters).

      "body": "In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and alert conditions violations, and replacing these pages with a new synthetic monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. For more information, check the EoL Announcements page. If you want to receive alert notifications when a synthetic monitor fails, you can configure the alert notification either while creating a monitor or after you have created one. You can configure your monitor's alert policy directly from the Synthetics UI or via the Alerts UI for existing monitors. To identify which monitors do not have policies assigned to them, review their color-coded health status. Add a synthetic monitor to alert policies A monitor can be included in multiple alert policies. You can view the alert policies and conditions for the selected monitor from the Synthetics UI or from the Alerts UI. To add an existing monitor to an alert policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies. From the list of existing alert policies, use the search box or scroll the list to locate one or more alert policies where the monitor has not already been added. Open the policy, then click Add a condition. Click Synthetics and then select the monitor. Fill out the remaining settings and click Create condition. Existing monitor: Remove from alert policy To remove an existing monitor from an existing alert policy: Go to one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies. From the list of existing alert policies, use the search box or scroll the list to locate one or more alert policies where the monitor has not already been added. Select the trash can (delete) icon on the monitor's row. Receive alert notifications on a three-strike basis Synthetic alert notifications operate on a three-strike basis, sending an alert after three monitor attempts from a single location return an error. Your alert policy configuration and notification channel settings will determine when you receive alerts for specific monitors and locations. If you monitor a non-public app and add your selected public minion IPs to your allow list, you may very infrequently receive a false downtime alert. When a synthetic monitoring data center goes down, New Relic may decide to temporarily use an alternate host, which results in the temporary server's IP being blocked by your app. Mute (disable) monitor's alert notifications To temporarily disable alerting for a monitor, mute it: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Monitors > (select a monitor). Click General under the Settings menu in the left menu sidebar. Click the Notifications button to Off. Muting a monitor's alert notifications will not mute multi-location alerts or NRQL alerts.

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubsribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubsribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "The C SDK is designed to support the often complex, multi-threaded nature of C/C++ applications. You can gain a new level of visibility to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also collect and analyze data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. The C SDK can be used to instrument a wide range of applications beyond C or C++. If your application does not use other languages supported by New Relic and can import C libraries, then you can use the New Relic C SDK to take advantage of our monitoring capabilities and features. Monitor app performance one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app): Here is an example of some of the data you can view in New Relic after you deploy the C SDK for your app. If your app meets the C SDK's compatibility and requirements in Linux environments, you can customize the generic library to communicate with New Relic, then start with APM to monitor your app's performance. What you can do How to do it See the big picture Start with the APM Summary page to monitor the throughput, response times, errors, memory and CPU usage transactions in your applications and services, then explore other details with additional APM dashboards. With deployment markers, see how code changes impact application performance and health. Use infrastructure monitoring to view detailed host and server data. When you install the infrastructure agent and APM on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by app in the Infrastructure UI. Identify and fix errors Use error analytics tools to find bottlenecks by seeing time spent on database calls, external system calls, and key blocks of code. Get alert notifications for problems or errors before they affect users. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Analyze business data Query user-related data and improve business processes. Send your own custom data to New Relic. Create custom queries of your application data. Create and share visual, interactive displays of your data. And more! Monitor and troubleshoot your application users' desktop experience with your application, including page load timing problems, JavaScript errors, session trace timelines, etc., by using browser monitoring. Use automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints with synthetic monitoring. Analyze and fine-tune your Android and iOS application performance, troubleshoot crashes, compare multiple versions, and examine the performance of HTTP and other network components with mobile monitoring. Architecture: C library and daemon The C SDK relies on two components to send data from your application to New Relic: The lC SDK calls: You download this library, then add the calls and instrumentation to your application's code. This allows you to identify and customize the kinds of data that matters the most to you. The C SDK daemon: This is a separate binary that accumulates data from the C SDK calls, and sends it to New Relic. This acts as a proxy between the SDK and New Relic. C SDK architecture: To send data from your application to New Relic, the daemon must be invoked before making calls to your application's C SDK instrumentation library. Working together, the C SDK instrumentation and the daemon forward data on to New Relic where you can view and query data about transactions. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: An HTTPS link is established between the daemon and New Relic. The daemon must be invoked first, before your instrumented application is invoked. Next, socket communication is established between your instrumented application and the daemon. This occurs after successful calls to newrelic_new_app_config() and newrelic_create_app(). The call to newrelic_create_app() is non-blocking. Its second parameter allows you to specify an amount of time for your instrumented application to wait so that the socket communication is adequately established. For example: newrelic_app_t* app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); If your instrumented application sends transactions before both the daemon connection and your application's socket communication are established, data reported from your application will be lost. Get started with the C SDK To use our C SDK agent: Make sure your application meets the compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. If you do not already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. Use our launcher, or follow the installation and instrumentation procedures to install the agent. Within a few minutes, you will be able to view data from your application in your New Relic account's UI. Read the install docs Add C data Check the source code The C SDK is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

      "info": "Add a table to your New Relic One app.",
      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git` cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` Copy Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID npm install # Install dependencies nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Copy Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the `nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` subdirectory and open the `index.js` file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done!

Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation).

      "body": "Query and store data 10 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here you can learn how to use the SDK query components, which allow you to make queries and mutations via NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. Query-related React components can be identified by the Query suffix. Mutation-related components can be identified by the Mutation prefix. Components overview Our data components are based on React Apollo. The most basic component is NerdGraphQuery, which accepts any GraphQL (or GraphQL AST generated by the graphql-tag library as the query parameter, and a set of query variables passed as variables. Over this query, we have created an additional set of queries, which can be divided into four groups: User queries: These allow you to query the current user and its associated accounts. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery and AccountsQuery. Entities queries: Because New Relic One is entity-centric, we use queries to make access to your entities easier. You can count, search, list, query, and favorite them. Components in this category: EntityCountQuery, EntitySearchQuery, EntitiesByDomainTypeQuery, EntitiesByGuidsQuery, EntityByGuidQuery, EntityByNameQuery. Storage queries: New Relic One provides a simple storage mechanism that we call NerdStorage. This can be used by Nerdpack creators to store application configuration setting data, user-specific data, and other small pieces of data. Components in this category: UserStorageQuery, AccountStorageQuery, EntityStorageQuery, UserStorageMutation, AccountStorageMutation, and EntityStorageMutation. For details, see NerdStorage. NRQL queries: To be able to query your New Relic data via NRQL (New Relic Query Language), we provide a NrqlQuery component. This component can return data in different formats, so that you can use it for charting and not only for querying. Query components All query components accept a function as a children prop where the different statuses can be passed. This callback receives an object with the following properties: loading: Boolean that is set to true when data fetching is happening. Our components use the cache-and-network strategy, meaning that after the data has loaded, subsequent data reloads might be triggered first with stale data, then refreshed when the most recent data has arrived. data: Root property where the data requested is retrieved. The structure matches a root structure based on the NerdGraph schema. This is true even for highly nested data structures, which means you’ll have to traverse down to find the desired data. error: Contains an Error instance when the query fails. Set to undefined when data is loading or the fetch was successful. fetchMore: Callback function that can be called when the query is being loaded in chunks. The function will only be present when it’s feasible to do so, more data is available, and no fetchMore has already been triggered. Data is loaded in batches of 200 by default. Other components provided by the platform (like the Dropdown or the List) are capable of accepting fetchMore, meaning you can combine them easily. Mutation components Mutation components also accept a children as a function, like the query ones. The mutation can be preconfigured at the component level, and a function is passed back that you can use in your component. This is the standard React Apollo approach for performing mutations, but you might find it easier to use our static mutation method added to the component. More on this topic below. Static methods All of the described components also expose a static method so that they can be used imperatively rather than declaratively. All Query components have a static Query method, and all Mutation components have a mutation method. These static methods accept the same props as their query component, but passed as an object. For example: // Declarative way (using components). function renderAccountList() { return ( <ul> <AccountsQuery> ({data, error}) => { if (error) { return <li>Failed to retrieve list: {error.message}</li>; } return data.map((account) => { <li key={account.id}>{account.name}</li> }); }} </AccountsQuery> </ul> ); } // Imperative way (using promises). async function getAccountList() { let data = {}; try { data = await AccountsQuery.query(); } catch (error) { console.log('Failed to retrieve list: ' + error.message); return; } return data.actor.accounts.map((account) => { return account.name; }); } Copy Similarly, a mutation can happen either way; either declaratively or imperatively. NrqlQuery NrqlQuery deserves additional explanation, because there are multiple formats in which you can return data from it. To provide maximum functionality, all three are exposed through a formatType property. You can find its different values under NrqlQuery.formatType: NERD_GRAPH: Returns the format in which it arrives from NerdGraph. RAW: The format exposed by default in Insights and dashboards when being plotted as JSON. This format is useful if you have a pre-existing script in this format that you're willing to migrate to or incorporate with. CHART: The format used by the charting engine that we also expose. You can find a more detailed explanation of how to manipulate this format in the guide to chart components, and some examples. If you are willing to push data, we currently do not expose NrqlMutation. To do that, see the Event API for how to add custom events.",

      "body": "These are frequently asked questions about the New Relic One pricing plan. Frequently asked questions Q: Where can I find more information about New Relic One and related Products? A: For a high level description of user entitlements for Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability (Standard, Pro, and Enterprise; also referred to as full users), and AI, please visit our pricing page. Q: Is there a limit on the number of concurrent sessions or IP addresses that may be used with a user account? A: Yes. The current limits are described in Users and roles. Q: What terms govern my use of the Products? A: If a Customer has paid New Relic during a rolling 12-month period, then Customer’s usage of the Products is covered by the Paid Terms of Service. If a Customer has not paid New Relic during a 12-month period, then Customer’s usage of the Products is covered by the Unpaid Terms of Service. Q: How are the number of Monthly Provisioned Users (full users) calculated for each month? A: Please see Calculation details. Q: Can I mix and match New Relic One Standard, Pro, and Enterprise users in a billing account? A: No. You can only select one type of New Relic One User per billing account ID. Q: If I am an existing customer under the product-based pricing plan, I purchased extended retention, and I move to New Relic One-based pricing, will I lose my extended retention benefits? A: Unless otherwise stated in an Order, Customers that previously purchased extended retention for their products under the product-based pricing plan (i.e., New Relic Insights Pro and/or New Relic Logs) have access to that same level of extended retention under New Relic One-based pricing for its initial New Relic One term at no additional cost. Customers that did not previously purchase extended retention for their products under the original, product-based pricing plan have the default retention per the Documentation and may purchase extended retention. Q: Can Event extended retention, additional Synthetics Checks, or additional New Relic Edge data be added to my account? A: For additional retention for Events or Logs beyond the Standard Data Retention, contact your New Relic Account Executive. Note: Minimum requirement for Extended Retention is that the Customer must have a Annual Pool of Funds subscription which includes all of the following: Telemetry Data Platform, Full Stack Observability Pro or above. Telemetry Data Platform Pricing is affected. Q: What is included in New Relic's Free Tier of Products? A: Please see this page for a description of what's included. Customer’s use of the Free Tier shall be governed by the terms and conditions described in the Unpaid Terms of Service. If Customer’s usage exceeds the Free Tier, Customer is fully responsible for fees incurred in excess of the Free Tier as described in the “Pay As You Go” program and as described in the Paid Terms of Service. Q: How does the ‘Free Tier’ impact my PAYG or Annual Pool of Funds subscription? A: The Free Tier usage will be deducted automatically from the Monthly Product Usage for Pay As You Go or Annual Pool of Funds subscriptions.

Back to top icon New Relic Insights Overview Features Use Cases FAQ Resources New Relic Dashboards and Analytics Frequently Asked Questions What data analytics capabilities does New Relic provide? What is NRQL? Do I need to be a developer (or know SQL) to use New Relic? What database does New Relic use? What Events are collected in New Relic? Can I send to New Relic the additional data that my app collects? Can I add external data to New Relic? Can I extract data from New Relic? How much does New Relic cost? What is the data retention period for events I can query? What data analytics capabilities does New Relic provide? New Relic provides a real-time analytics platform that collects metrics, events, logs, and traces directly from your live production software, infrastructure, and services, transforming them into actionable insights about your entire stack, your business, and your customers' experiences. What is NRQL? NRQL, New Relic Query Language, is a SQL-like query language used to query the New Relic Database. Read more on how to get started using NRQL. Do I need to be a developer (or know SQL) to use New Relic? SQL knowledge will help in getting started with using New Relic like a pro, but it is not a required skill. New Relic comes equipped with built-in tutorials to get you up to speed quickly with its capabilities, pre-built example queries to experiment with, a point-and-click Chart Builder for querying your data, as well as an autocomplete feature to help guide the way when writing your own queries. What database does New Relic use? New Relic is powered by New Relic Database, a highly-distributed cloud-hosted time series database with an innovative architecture that does not require indexing. The database runs on a super-cluster built to support our thousands of customers - enabling you to query your big data in milliseconds. Learn more about New Relic Database. What Events are collected in New Relic? Out of the box, New Relic collects data on three event types from your web and mobile applications. For web applications, New Relic automatically collects PageViews events, which are instrumented by New Relic's Browser agent and Transaction events, which are instrumented by New Relic APM agents (.NET, Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, Node.js). For native mobile applications, New Relic automatically collects MobileSession events directly from your native mobile applications using the New Relic Mobile APM SDKs (iOS and Android). By default, New Relic Synthetics populates a set of default attributes. Query SyntheticCheck to return metrics from one run of a particular monitor, while SyntheticRequest attributes return results from individual HTTP requests made during a check. Can I send to New Relic the additional data that my app collects? Yes, New Relic has designed adding custom attributes to be a simple process. It typically requires no more than one additional line of code to your app per attribute. Decorating your PageView and Transaction events with custom attributes is a powerful way to collect events from your software that are not collected out of the box. MobileSession Events do not currently support adding custom attributes. Learn more about how to add custom attributes and what kind of data you can add. Can I add external data to New Relic? Yes, New Relic is an open platform, allowing you to send metric, event, log, and trace data from 3rd party instrumentation sources. For example, use custom events to store data in New Relic that is not available during a page view, server transaction or mobile session event. Learn more about how New Relic supports open instrumentation to ingest metrics data from Prometheus, tracing data instrumented with Zipkin, or logs data from Fluentd. Can I extract data from New Relic? Exporting data from New Relic is available via New Relic's API or via JSON code provided with each chart, graph and dashboard. Find out more about exporting New Relic data.  How much does New Relic cost? New Relic's subscription pricing is based on the number of metrics, events, logs, and traces stored in New Relic Database. Customers should reach out to an account executive to determine pricing. What is the data retention period for events I can query? Data retention varies based on the type of data stored (metrics, events, logs, and traces), and is generally up to you. New Relic has customizable data retention settings, so in some cases you can keep data in New Relic for as long as you want. Prices are determined by the amount of data that you store, so you will want to choose a retention period (where applicable) that meets your business and budgetary needs. Free access to New Relic. Forever. Monitor your stack for free with full platform access and 100GB of ingest per month. No credit card required.

Attributes may be found in APM if the transaction is associated with an error or if a transaction trace is generated for that transaction. Attributes can also be found and queried in New Relic One. Before you create custom attributes, review our list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description items list Required. Each item in the list must be a tuple, with the first element being a key, and the second its value. Each key is a string representing the name of an attribute, and each corresponding value is the value to add to the current transaction for this attribute.

Back to top icon New Relic Insights Overview Features Use Cases FAQ Resources New Relic Dashboards and Analytics Features With New Relic, you get a wide variety of methods to analyze and present custom, real-time data visualizations. Watch your data streaming in from New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation in one place. Sign up for free Request a demo Data Sources Data Analysis Data Presentation Integrations Data Sources New Relic offers the ability to automatically stream your data from New Relic agents (APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure) and 3rd party instrumentation (Prometheus, DropWizard, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Fluentd, and more!) for deeper analysis, segmentation, and filtering. Leverage your New Relic data You're already receiving the raw data that powers the out-of-the-box views you see in our products. You can customize and create dashboards and visualizations to focus in on the data you want to see, and answer your key questions about application performance and customer experience—all in real-time. APM: Transactions By default, New Relic APM agents send transactions, transaction errors, and spans to New Relic Database. Transaction events includes information about your app, database calls, the duration of the transaction, and any errors that may occur. Transaction errors occur when a request throws an exception in the code's path that was taken to fill a request. New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation create spans when an individual unit of work is done in a distributed system. You can also add custom attributes to existing events or add custom events using the language agent APIs. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticCheck Every time a synthetic check is run off a given monitor, we track a SyntheticCheck request. For every Synthetics monitor you have, you can sort your analysis for the most common errors and most frequent error messages, pinpointing issues in your application. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticRequest We create a SyntheticRequest event when we receive a response from your web application for a check we run. Analyze application activity by response code, determine which third party services are slowing your website down, and uncover the content taking up the majority of your page load time. Learn more. Browser: PageView A PageView event is recorded when your web application has a page load and the New Relic Browser agent fires. Analyze detailed statistics on browser type and version usage for your customers, understand how different geographic regions are performing, and create detailed user journeys based on the PageViews from a single session. Learn more. Mobile: MobileSession A MobileSession event begins when any user starts your app. Understand how users are adopting your application and the key screens that they spend time on. Learn which devices and models your team needs to support. Track core mobile KPIs on user activity and engagement. Learn more. Open instrumentation: Metrics, Traces, and Logs New Relic’s open platform allows you to send virtually any telemetry data from in-house, open source, and vendor-agnostic tools to display that information alongside all the other systems and services data you’re managing. Use pre-built exporters and our telemetry SDKs to send metrics from Prometheus, DropWizard, and Micrometer (and more), traces using Zipkin, and logs from Fluentd, fluentbit, and other open source tools. Or send other telemetry data directly to our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API. Add your own business data Providing customers with the ability to aggregate, filter, segment, and combine unique sets of their New Relic data is just the start. To take your application performance analysis to the next level, it’s critical that you add your own content to your data. In New Relic, you can do that in two ways; by enriching an existing data stream with custom attributes, or by importing data from other data sources. Custom attributes Add important context to your existing data with custom attributes. By adding one line of code to your application, you can track useful information such as customer or account ID. After adding this single attribute, you'll be able to segment your performance data by customer or account, and understand the exact performance, issues, errors, and features that customer is experiencing. Learn more about implementing and leveraging custom attributes. Custom events Import data in JSON format to our Event API, and analyze that data in New Relic. A common example of using the custom events API is to import additional datasets alongside data that New Relic agents capture natively for deeper analysis. While some use cases have centered around tracking infrastructure performance, server metrics, or more detailed user analytics, there are also a variety of customers using custom events and New Relic dashboards as a general toolset for real-time analytics. Some of our customers pull in data from other business and technical systems completely independent of application performance. Custom logs Beyond providing granular log visibility for New Relic sources, customers can also ingest and analyze any text-based data originating on-prem or in the cloud to troubleshoot incidents and reduce the mean time to resolution (MTTR). Data Analysis New Relic dashboards give you a powerful array of capabilities and visualizations for analyzing your data in real-time. The main method of querying data in New Relic is via our SQL-flavored language, New Relic Query Language (NRQL). All of the visualizations, analyses and capabilities below are leveraged via NRQL. For details on how to use these different features, refer to our NRQL documentaiton. Visual Data Explorer Explore your data, visually, with a point, click, and search interface for creating charts and analyses in seconds. Understand the types of data captured within New Relic by sampling individual metrics, events, logs, and traces. Grab the auto-generated NRQL to quickly copy and modify it to take your analysis to the next level. Heatmaps Go beyond histograms and create a heatmap by segmenting your histogram by device, geography, browser, or any other aspect of your data. Basics Visualizations Use out-of-the-box visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and numbers widgets to discover trends in your data. Funnels Determine whether low conversion rates at various stages of your funnel (eg, sign up, checkout, or subscribe) are impacted by different levels of performance. Cohorts Create a cohort analysis for your users, and understand how different sets of users engage with your application based on time of day, month, or year. Segmentation Segment your application data in a variety of ways based on default attributes or attributes you add. Histograms Track a performance histogram of any duration metric for a given transaction, pageview, or group of application activity. Filters and linking Create powerful filters that can be applied to any dashboard. You can also use this feature to link multiple dashboards together, creating drill down reports for non-technical users. Data Presentation Whether you need to present a variety of metrics and visualizations in a meeting or on the go, embed charts into your own application, or create self-service dashboards for other teams. Dashboards Dashboards are the most common method of sharing important data stored in New Relic, giving you a simple way to create purpose-specific reports that can be shared in meetings or a heads-up display on a monitor. Whether providing customer support with the ability to understand customer activity around an error or crash, or giving the product team a simple way to understand engagement with top features, dashboards provide a simple, yet powerful, way to share the wealth of data accessible within New Relic. Learn more. Embedded Charts For a real-time view of your telemetry data within your own internal- or customer-facing reporting solutions, New Relic allows you to embed any data widget. And your queries will continue to run and load data in real-time, keeping data consumers up-to-date. Learn more. Mobile App New Relic's mobile app allows you to access any of your dashboards and reports on the go.

      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git` cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` Copy Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID npm install # Install dependencies nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Copy Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the `nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` subdirectory and open the `index.js` file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done! Keep exploring the Table components, their properties, and how to use them, in our SDK documentation.",

      "info": "Intro to New Relic One API components",
      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Add, query, and mutate data using NerdStorage 45 min NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: cd / nr1 - how - to / use - nerdstorage; Copy Update the UUID and serve the application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button. Next steps Now that you’ve successfully implemented NerdStorage into a New Relic One application, you can store and mutate data connected to your User.

      "body": "Intro to NerdStorage 30 min To help you build a New Relic One application, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. On this page, you’ll learn how to use NerdStorage SDK components. Use NerdStorage in your apps NerdStorage is used to store and retrieve simple sets of data, including users's configuration settings and preferences (like favorites), or any other small data sets. This storage is unique per Nerdpack, and can't be shared with any other Nerdpack. NerdStorage can be classified into three categories: User storage: Data that is attached to a particular user. If you’re authenticated as the user the data is attached to, you can read it and write it. Account storage: Data that is attached to a particular account. If you’re authenticated and can access the account, you can read and write to account scoped NerdStorage. Visibility of account data is also determined by master/subaccount rules: If a user has access to the master account, then they also have access to data in all subaccounts. Entity storage: Data that is attached to a particular entity. If you can see the corresponding entity, you can read and write data on that entity. Data model You can imagine NerdStorage as a nested key-value map. Data is inside documents, which are nested inside collections: { 'YourNerdpackUuid': { 'collection-1': { 'document-1-of-collection-1': '{\"lastNumber\": 42, \"another\": [1]}', 'document-2-of-collection-1': '\"userToken\"', // ... }, 'another-collection': { 'fruits': '[\"pear\", \"apple\"]', // ... }, // ... }, } Copy Each NerdStorage level has different properties and purpose: Collections: From a Nerdpack, you can create multiple collections by naming each of them. Inside a collection you can put one or more documents. Think of a collection as key-value storage, where each document is a key-value pair. Documents: A document is formed by an identifier (documentId) and a set of data associated with it. Data associated with a document: NerdStorage accepts any sort of data associated to a documentId. Query and mutation components that are provided work by serializing and deserializing JSON. Limits A Nerdpack can hold up to 1,000 collections and 10,000 documents, plus storage type. A collection can hold up to 1,000 documents, plus storage type. Each document can have a maximum length of 64 KiB when serialized. Data access To access NerdStorage, you can run NerdGraph queries, or use the provided storage queries. Depending on which storage you want to access, you can use a different set of SDK components: User access: UserStorageQuery and UserStorageMutation Account access: AccountStorageQuery and AccountStorageMutation Entity access: EntityStorageQuery and EntityStorageMutation Each of these components can operate declaratively (for example, as part of your React rendering methods) or imperatively (by using the static methods for query and mutation). For more information on this, see Data querying and mutations. Permissions for working with NerdStorage In order to persist changes on NerdStorage, such as creating, updating, and deleting account and entity storage, you must have a user role with permission to persist changes.",

      "body": "The New Relic Java agent API lets you control, customize, and extend the functionality of the APM Java agent. This API consists of: Static methods on the com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic class A @Trace annotation for implementing custom instrumentation A hierarchy of API objects providing additional functionality Use this API to set up custom instrumentation of your Java app and collect more in-depth data. For detailed information about this API, see the complete Javadoc on GitHub. Another way to set up custom instrumentation is to use XML instrumentation. The XML option is simpler and does not require modification of your app code, but it lacks the complete functionality of the Java agent API. For best results when using the API, ensure that you have the latest Java agent release. Several APIs used in the examples require Java agent 3.36.0 or higher. For all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Use the API To access the API class, add newrelic-api.jar to your application class path. The jar is in the New Relic Java agent's installation zip file. You can call the API when the Java agent is not running. The API methods are just stubs; the implementation is added when the Java agent loads the class. Transactions To instrument Transactions in your application, use the following APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a Transaction when New Relic does not create one automatically @Trace(dispatcher = true) on the method that encompasses the work to be reported. When this annotation is used on a method within the context of an existing transaction, this will not start a new transaction, but rather include the method in the existing transaction. Capture the duration of a method that New Relic does not automatically trace @Trace() on the method you want to time. Set the name of the current Transaction NewRelic.setTransactionName(...) Start the timer for the response time of the current Transaction and to cause a Transaction you create to be reported as a Web transaction, rather than as an Other transaction NewRelic.setRequestAndReponse(...) Add custom attributes to Transactions and TransactionEvents NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) Prevent a Transaction from being reported to New Relic NewRelic.ignoreTransaction() Exclude a Transaction when calculating your app's Apdex score NewRelic.ignoreApdex() Instrument asynchronous work For detailed information, see Java agent API for asynchronous applications. If you want to... Use this Trace an asynchronous method if it is linked to an existing Transaction... @Trace(async = true) Link the Transaction associated with the Token on the current thread... Token.link() or Token.linkAndExpire() Expire a Token associated with the current Transaction... Token.expire() Stop timing a Segment and have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.end() Stop timing a Segment and not have it report as part of its parent Transaction Segment.ignore() Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Use this Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Transaction.createDistributedTracePayload() For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other entities, see Obtain references. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace. Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload(...) For more on obtaining references to the current transaction and other entities, see Obtain references. Payload used to connect services. The text() call returns a JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.text() Payload used to connect services. The httpSafe() call returns a base64 encoded JSON string representation of the payload. DistributedTracePayload.httpSafe() Add custom attributes to SpanEvents in distributed traces NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().addCustomAttribute(...) Implement cross application tracing To track external calls and add cross application tracing, use the following APIs: If you want to... Use this Trace across a custom transport channel that New Relic does not support by default, such as a proprietary RPC transport Transaction.getRequestMetadata(), .processRequestMetadata(...), .getResponseMetadata(), .processResponseMetadata(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic entities. View or change the metric name or a rollup metric name of a TracedMethod (A rollup metric name, such as OtherTransaction/all, is not scoped to a specific transaction. It represents all background transactions.) TracedMethod.getMetricName(), .setMetricName(...), .setRollupMetricName(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Report a call to an external HTTP service, database server, message queue, or other external resource that is being traced using the Java agent API's @Trace annotation TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) passing arguments constructed using ExternalParameters builder. Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Enable and add cross application tracing when communicating with an external HTTP or JMS service that is instrumented by New Relic TracedMethod.addOutboundRequestHeaders(...) along with TracedMethod.reportAsExternal(...) Also refer to the information in this document about using TracedMethod to obtain references to New Relic entities. Add timing for an application server or dispatcher that is not supported automatically Transaction.setRequest(...), Transaction.setResponse(...), or NewRelic.setRequestAndResponse(...), and Transaction.markResponseSent() Also refer to the information in this document about using Transaction to obtain references to New Relic entities. Obtain references to New Relic entities Other tasks require the New Relic Agent object. The Agent object exposes multiple objects that give you the following functionality: If you want to... Use this Get a reference to the current Transaction NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction() Get a Token to link asynchronous work NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken() Start and get a reference to a Segment NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().startSegment() Get a reference to the method currently being traced NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod() Get a reference to the Agent logger NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger() Get a reference to the Agent configuration NewRelic.getAgent().getConfig() Get a reference to an aggregator for custom metrics NewRelic.getAgent().getAggregator() Get a reference to Insights in order to record custom events NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights() Additional API functionality The following APIs provide additional functionality, such as setting app server info, reporting errors, adding page load timing information, recording custom metrics, and sending custom events to Insights. If you want to... Use this Explicitly set port, name, and version information for an application server or dispatcher and the instance name for a JVM NewRelic.setAppServerPort(...), .setServerInfo(...), and .setInstanceName(...) Report an error that New Relic does not report automatically NewRelic.noticeError(...) When inside a transaction, the first call to noticeError wins. Only 1 error will be reported per transaction. Add browser page load timing for Transactions that New Relic does not add to the header automatically NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader(), .getBrowserTimingFooter(), .setUserName(String name), .setAccountName(String name), and .setProductName(String name) Create and accumulate custom metrics NewRelic.recordMetric(...), .recordResponseTimeMetric(...), or .incrementCounter(...) Record custom events Insights.recordCustomEvent(...) Or, use NewRelic.addCustomParameter(...) to add custom attributes to the New Relic-defined TransactionEvent type. Also refer to the information in this document about using Insights to obtain references to New Relic entities.

In addition to instrumenting your web frameworks, you can also instrument calls to and from messaging systems, database calls, and external calls! By passing context about your code to the APIs, you will get the same reporting, including cross application tracing, that you get with New Relic’s built-in instrumentation. Solr This release adds support for Solr versions 5 and 6 (up to and including version 6.3.0). Fixes Fixes a bug that prevents an application from starting up when a JAX-RS annotated method contains more than 8 parameters. Fixes an issue that affected Spring and JAX-RS applications compiled with the Java 8 flag javac -parameters. The issue would cause the application to throw a java.lang.reflect.MalformedParametersException exception. Fixes bug that affected applications implementing JAX-RS endpoints using static methods. The agent now reports WildFly dispatcher name and version. Fixes a bug in which Queue Time could be misreported on the Overview page for customers injecting the X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start HTTP headers.

      "body": "newrelic.agent.function_trace(name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Used to instrument functions, methods, generators, and coroutines that aren't instrumented by default. Description function_trace is a decorator for adding to functions, methods, generators, and coroutines. Adding this decorator lets you collect additional transaction information (including transaction trace information). (An alternate way to instrument functions without having to touch your app code is to list them in the config file.) function_trace does not give you a full profile of all the functions that happen in a decorated function. What it does is add the decorated function as a node in the New Relic UI and capture the time spent in that function. If you need more detail about what is going on in that function, you would need to also apply the function trace to the function's child functions. The function_trace decorator can be used on generators and coroutines with agent version 2.102.0.85 or higher. Timing of these objects begins when consumption starts, and ends when the object is exhausted or goes out of scope. This is a change from earlier versions where the metric represented the time taken to create the generator or coroutine object itself. You can use the decorator in conjunction with existing decorators, including those for static and class methods. When nesting multiple decorators, have the function_trace decorator as the outermost decorator. For any decorators that are being wrapped, use functools.wraps() from the Python standard library in their implementation. (Or, otherwise ensure that the decorator propagates the correct name attributes of the innermost wrapped object required to allow correct name introspection.) If this is not done, then when the metric is reported, the name of the nested decorator function (not the innermost wrapped function) will be used. Alternate call forms For setups where you cannot use the decorator, these alternate call forms are available: The context manager The FunctionTrace context manager is used when the parameters to be passed cannot be determined before runtime. (For example, you may not know the name of a function at import time.) When using the context manager to name a metric, you must always supply the name and the metric path prefix. The FunctionTrace class implements the context manager and is used in conjunction with the with statement. The FunctionTrace class is the lowest level primitive available for tracing time against a transaction. The with statement defines the bounds of what is timed and not a single function. Thus, the context manager could be applied to an arbitrary block of code. The block of code could therefore contain calls to multiple functions, or it could be a self-contained block of code implementing a time-oriented algorithm that you want to track. Avoid tracing blocks of code that are called an excessive number of times. For example, do not use it within the context of a loop that executes many times. The data generated will incur a performance overhead. A better solution is to enclose the loop. The wrapper If you know in advance where the specific functions you want to trace are, you could use the function_trace decorator. However, if you don't know all the functions that need to be traced (for example, if they're being looked up dynamically as part of a routing system), then you must use the FunctionTraceWrapper to wrap the function at the time of registration or at the time of calling. Path-based wrapping wrap_function_trace is used for wrapping functions outside of the code they're declared in. For example: you might use this to instrument library code that you don't want to modify. For more about the differences between these call formats, see Different call formats. Parameters Parameters for decorator newrelic.agent.function_trace(name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) This call includes these parameters: Parameter Description name string Optional. The function name. If not set, defaults to the captured name of the function. group string Optional. The group represents the naming structure for the name parameter. This is used in the UI for segregating the transaction types. If not supplied, the group will default to Function in expectation that the name is of the form module:class.function or module:function and represents the name of the function being executed. If you are creating a custom group, it's recommended you prefix it with Python/. label string Optional. Adds a callout-style flag to the segment in a transaction trace. Default is None. params dict Optional. Custom parameters to add to the segment in transaction traces. terminal boolean Optional. If true, no children segments will be recorded. Default is False. Parameters for context manager newrelic.agent.FunctionTrace(name, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Parameters for the context manager includes all of the parameters from function_trace. The name parameter is required and not optional. Parameter Description name string Required. The function name. Wrapper parameters newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper(wrapped, name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Parameters for the wrapper include all parameters for function_trace and a wrapped parameter: Parameter Description wrapped function Required. The function being wrapped. Path-based wrapping parameters newrelic.agent.wrap_function_trace(module, object_path, name=None, group=None, label=None, params=None, terminal=False) Parameters include all parameters for function_trace and these parameters: Parameter Description module object Required. The module containing the function to be instrumented. object_path string The path to the location of the function. Example(s) function_trace example An example of using the function_trace decorator: import newrelic.agent class _Database(UserDict.DictMixin): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() def _commit(self): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() def open(file, flag=None, mode=0666): ... An example of using the function_trace decorator with native coroutines: import newrelic.agent class _Database(UserDict.DictMixin): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() async def _commit(self): ... @newrelic.agent.function_trace() async def open(file, flag=None, mode=0666): ... Context manager example An example of using the FunctionTrace context manager: import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) with newrelic.agent.FunctionTrace( endpoint, 'Python/EndPoint'): return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e Wrapper example An example of using the FunctionTraceWrapper: URL routing with Werkzeug yields a name that is used first to dynamically look up a method of a class using getattr() and the result then invoked: def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() return getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint)(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e If you want to trace the endpoint function, you can rewrite this as: import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) function = newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper(function) return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e If you want to name the metric after the endpoint name (rather than naming the metric based on the identifier for the function being called), you can supply the name to use plus an alternate metric path prefix when the FunctionTraceWrapper object is created. import newrelic.agent def dispatch_request(self, request): adapter = self.url_map.bind_to_environ(request.environ) try: endpoint, values = adapter.match() function = getattr(self, 'on_' + endpoint) function = newrelic.agent.FunctionTraceWrapper( function, name=endpoint, group='Python/EndPoint') return function(request, **values) except HTTPException as e: return e For this example, if the endpoint were called help, the final metric would be: Python/EndPoint/help In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category would be Python and the segment name EndPoint/help. That segment name would also appear in slow transaction traces as the node name.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

      "body": "Intro to New Relic One API components To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: an object that provides write access to the Nerdlet URL state.",

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

Read on to learn about permissions and versions. Permissions for managing applications The Nerdpack manager role is a New Relic add-on role. When you create a Nerdpack, you have the Nerdpack manager role for handling that Nerdpack. New Relic account administrators have the Nerdpack manager role automatically, and can subscribe their accounts to available Nerdpacks. User permissions vary depending on which pricing plan you are on. New Relic One pricing plan For accounts with New Relic One pricing, there are permissions differences for basic users and full users: Full users have the Nerdpack manager role and have full capabilities for creating and managing New Relic One applications, as well as accessing all types of applications in the New Relic One catalog. A basic user can develop and view their own local New Relic One apps, but they cannot: Subscribe other users to apps they’ve created. Access or manage apps in the New Relic One catalog.

Original product-based pricing For accounts on our original product-based pricing, here are access details: Subscribe to publicly available applications To subscribe to publicly available applications, you must have the Nerdpack manager role. Nerdpack manager permissions are automatically assigned to New Relic account owners and admins and can be assigned to individual users. If you aren’t an owner or admin, you can request Nerdpack manager permission, or ask your New Relic admin or owner to subscribe the apps to your account for you. You can add any of the publicly available applications to master accounts or separate sub-accounts on which you have the Nerdpack manager role, or to separate sub-accounts under a master account you own or administer. If you add the application to a master account, the access flows to all of its sub-accounts as well. Subscribe to applications that you create You also must have the Nerdpack manager role to subscribe the applications you create to accounts. Applications that you publish and deploy can only be subscribed to the master account that was used to publish them, or to its sub-accounts. This means you might want a New Relic admin to deploy your applications for you if they need to be available across the organization.",

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from `nr1`; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors. Reload your app to see the pageview data on the map!",

Back to top icon Article Tips and Tricks for Monitoring AWS with New Relic Here are five best practices that can help you boost end-user experiences, simplify performance management, and optimize your AWS environment to suit your applications. Links Download PDF Whether you’re a seasoned New Relic user or are just starting to understand how the New Relic platform works, there’s always a new tip or trick you can use to improve the performance of your cloud-hosted applications. Here are five best practices that can help you boost end-user experiences, simplify performance management, and optimize your AWS environment to suit your applications: 1. Right-size your AWS instances The transient nature of EC2 instances can make it difficult to get an accurate view of your AWS ecosystem. Your company may have many different individuals or groups who are spinning up EC2 instances for various purposes. Because of this, a complete view of the current state of your AWS environment is essential. A decommissioned host is not a “dead” server; rather, it has merely served its purpose. Using New Relic Infrastructure, you instantly get an accurate snapshot of your EC2 instances, which allows you to then dissect them by the AWS tags you already use. Ultimately, this 360-degree view of your infrastructure allows you to optimize (or right-size) your AWS instances for maximum ROI. 2. Monitor all the (AWS) things While EC2 powers most AWS workloads, it’s by no means the only AWS service used to power modern applications. To fully understand how your AWS ecosystem is performing, you need to monitor the other services you use. New Relic Infrastructure Professional allows you to monitor the performance health of many popular AWS services, such as CloudFront, DynamoDB, EBS, ElastiCache, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), IAM, Kinesis, RDS, SNS, SQS, and VPC, to name just a few of the services New Relic can monitor. To use these services effectively, you need context. For example, AWS ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances, which you don’t always have visibility into. But by tracking ELB requests per second as well as write and read volume in New Relic Insights, you can understand exactly how that load is being balanced to make sure you’re using the service as effectively as possible. 3. Set up auto-scaling alerts and dashboards Ops teams depend on critical alerts and custom dashboards to tell the whole story about infrastructure performance. That’s why New Relic makes it easy for you to set thresholds for alerts on various metrics relating to your applications, servers, and key transactions. As EC2 instances come and go, your alerts and dashboards need to auto-scale with them. You can manage alerts by creating specified user groups and by leveraging New Relic’s integrated alert channels, including OpsGenie, PagerDuty, Slack, VictorOps, and Campfire. If you’re using a different alerting solution, use our Webhook feature to send a JSON Object anywhere you choose. New Relic also gives you the option to create customized dashboards for a curated view of what you care about most when running your applications in an AWS ecosystem. 4. Automate your setup When you’re operating in a dynamic AWS environment, your underlying infrastructure is constantly shifting. While AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning the resources, it raises the obvious question of how your application software is deployed, configured, and executed on your Amazon EC2 instances. That’s why you should consider using an automation solution like Chef or Puppet, which can automatically configure your systems and apps that sit on top of your infrastructure. Both tools make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. When these config management tools are combined with New Relic Infrastructure, you get an instant view of your EC2 metrics, as well as the change events associated with their configuration. 5. Keep an eye on the entire stack The great thing about using New Relic to monitor your AWS applications is that it doesn’t just give you visibility into a certain portion of your application stack, but lets you see the entire thing—even if you’re running in a hybrid cloud, on-premise, or both. If you spot a performance problem in New Relic APM, for example, you can easily correlate to issues with your infrastructure using New Relic Infrastructure. You can test your application from outside the firewall using New Relic Synthetics, see what’s going on at the interaction level using New Relic Browser, and also organize, query, and visualize all this data using New Relic Insights to answer key questions about application and customer experience—all in real time. Performance monitoring for AWS Build, migrate, and deploy your applications and infrastructure faster with AWS monitoring from New Relic.

Back to top icon WHITE PAPER Guide to Getting Started with New Relic APM Tips and tricks for gaining comprehensive visibility with the most trusted application performance monitoring solution Table of Contents Introduction 1. Standardize application-naming conventions 2. Add labels to your applications 3. Create and evaluate alert policies 4. Identify and set up key transactions 5. Leverage New Relic’s reporting capabilities 6. Look at your environment holistically 7. Keep your agents current 8. Automate user management and single sign-on Download PDF Introduction Whether it’s outages, crashes, or lags, organizations with unreliable software won’t have users for very long. Manually troubleshooting complex software or relying on customer complaints during urgent incidents is not only incredibly stressful, it virtually guarantees your users will flee for a competitor before you even have time to resolve the issue. New Relic APM gives your modern development team the visibility needed to address problems quickly and proactively before they impact your users. In turn, you’re able do your job more effectively while improving the overall user experience. For software engineers, SREs, and DevOps professionals, New Relic APM provides real-time data about your application performance and the level of satisfaction that your end users experience. Our automatic instrumentation gives you built-in dashboards to see how your app is performing, whether it’s built in Java, Python, Go, or any of our supported languages. Combined with opinionated workflows, New Relic APM quickly detects anomalies, discovers deficiencies, and helps you identify ways to improve performance on key metrics for business-critical applications and distributed services. For those just entering the world of APM, it can seem pretty daunting. We get it, and we’re here to provide support on your journey from APM beginner to APM wizard. Once you’ve installed the New Relic APM agent, start by following these pointers to get the most out of this powerful tool. 1. Standardize application-naming conventions Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as “My Application” or “PHP Application” if you don’t specify the name in your New Relic configuration file. You don’t want to end up with 20 applications that all have the same name, so always be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, we also recommend standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in staging have [Staging] at the end of their name). Ideally, you want your new applications named automatically, rather than manually, to help cut down the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. HOW TO DO IT: 1. For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best with your needs and follow these steps. 2. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods so refer to the documentation for your agent. For non-Java apps, there’s no automatic naming but you can set the app name via a script to ensure consistency. For info about which config methods to use, see the documentation for your specific agent. 2. Add labels to your applications When you’ve got several different applications using the same account and each application spans multiple environments (e.g., development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That’s why we recommend adding labels to your apps so you can organize them by segmenting them into logical groups. The two most common labels that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in test, you could simply filter by “billing app” (name label) and “test” (environment label). New Relic APM is designed so that account owners and admins can label apps so they “roll up” into an unlimited number of meaningful categories. You can also easily sort, filter, and page through all applications on your account’s Applications list. HOW TO DO IT: From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications. From the Applications index, select Show Labels > On. To assign an app to a category, select the circled plus icon by its name. Follow the guidelines to type the label; use the format Category:Value. To save the new label, press Enter or Return. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies Most of your alerts are going to be based on your Apdex score, which measures users’ satisfaction with the response time of your application. Apdex T is the central value for Apdex—you want to make sure you set it at a value that is meaningful to your specific app. We recommend setting your Apdex T value to 0.95 seconds to strive for true optimization. Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you’re taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and leveraging New Relic’s integrated alert channels. Just be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. And, if you’re interested in helping your on-call teams detect, diagnose, and respond to incidents faster, check out New Relic Applied Intelligence (AI). HOW TO DO IT: Change your Apdex settings. Set up your alert notification channels. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic’s key transactions feature is designed to let you closely monitor what you decide are your app’s most business-critical transactions, whether that’s end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, and more. You can also create alerts to notify you when your key transactions are performing poorly. HOW TO DO IT: From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Key transactions, and select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction. OR from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Leverage New Relic’s reporting capabilities From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools to surface historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports available, and use them to your advantage. HOW TO DO IT: To view a report, from the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you’d like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 6. Look at your environment holistically The great thing about using New Relic to monitor your applications is that it doesn’t just give you visibility into a certain portion of your application stack, but into the entirety of it. Say you’re an Amazon Web Services (AWS) user. New Relic Integrations offer a number of useful ways to give you added visibility into your AWS applications. From mobile and browser monitoring to synthetics testing and more, the New Relic platform is designed to provide end-to-end visibility into the performance of your applications. HOW TO DO IT: If you aren’t using any New Relic products beyond APM, sign up for other solutions that pique your interest. Many New Relic products offer a free demo and trial, which you can use to test out the solution before purchasing it. Once all products are deployed, you can easily switch between different New Relic products using the menu bar on the top of your overview screen. 7. Keep your agents current Most likely, your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Running the latest agents ensures that you have access to all our instrumentation, API methods, and bug fixes. (To see the latest improvements we’ve shipped to our agents, see our release notes.) Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. HOW TO DO IT: 1. Regularly review which version of the agent you’re using to know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or some additional functionality you want, download it. 2. To deploy the agent manually, see our instructions for full details. 3. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors), you can either: Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Check out our documentation for your agent to see what steps your script will need. 4. Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless the script handles this). 5. Run the deployment script. 6. Start the application (unless the script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back the version to the previous version. 8. Automate user management and single sign-on New Relic supports the SCIM 2.0 standard for automatically provisioning users and the SAML 2.0 standard to allow single sign-on (SSO). By configuring the New Relic SCIM/SSO application for your identity provider, you can automatically send New Relic any user permission changes you make within the identity provider. New Relic users can then be created, updated, and deactivated from your identity provider, without the separate step of having to use a New Relic UI or API. In addition, users can log in to New Relic by just clicking on the SCIM/SSO application tile from their identity provider home page. HOW TO DO IT: To get started with SCIM and SSO, you’ll need to work with your account representative on configuration by providing a list of the New Relic account IDs associated with your organization. For full details, check out Automated User Management. To obtain a SAML certificate, start by viewing a list of the SAML service providers that New Relic currently supports for SSO integration by going to the New Relic title bar, selecting (account dropdown) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign-on. To integrate with an SAML provider, you’ll need to provide information about your New Relic account, which you can learn more about in Integrating with a SAML Provider for SSO.

Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Configure whether and how open violations are force-closed. Adjust the evaluation offset. Create a concise and descriptive condition name. (NerdGraph API Only) Provide a text description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Troubleshooting procedures Optional: To include your organization's procedures for handling the incident, add the runbook URL to the condition. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions do not affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you cannot use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. NRQL alert syntax Here is the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. Depending on the threshold type, also include a FACET clause as applicable. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Optional Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Static: Optional Baseline: Not allowed Outlier: Required Including a FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depends on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than this number of values, the alert condition cannot be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of the one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum, and the preview chart will update accordingly. Offset the query time window Every minute, we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows. The start time depends on the value you select in the NRQL condition's Advanced settings > Evaluation offset. Example: Using the default time window to evaluate violations With the Evaluation offset at the default setting of three minutes, the NRQL time window applied to your query will be: SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago If the event type is sourced from an APM language agent and aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend evaluating data from three minutes ago or longer. An offset of less than 3 minutes will trigger violations sooner, but you might see more false positives and negatives due to data latency. For cloud data, such as AWS integrations, you may need an offset longer than 3 minutes. Check our AWS polling intervals documentation to determine your best setting. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Create a description You can define a description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by downstream systems.

      "body": "APM reports metric data in the form of metric timeslice data, and you can use NRQL to query and facet this type of data. Why query metric timeslice data? We report metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data we call metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile, and Browser (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Historically, this type of data couldn't be queried via our query language, NRQL. But now we are converting popular APM metrics from metric timeslice data to more-detailed dimensional metric data, which opens them up for querying via NRQL and via our NerdGraph API. This capability allows you to create powerful, in-depth custom visualizations of these important APM metrics. And this includes being able to query your custom metrics. Where to query? We recommend querying APM metric timeslice data using New Relic One query builder in advanced mode. This experience offers full NRQL functionality, and also gives helpful auto-complete suggestions and feedback on query errors. You can also incorporate NRQL queries in our NerdGraph (GraphQL) API. How to construct a query In APM, some charts have the option to view the NRQL query that generated that chart. This can be a good option for understanding how to query metrics. The NRQL query examined below is slightly modified from the error rate chart on the APM summary page. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') AND (transactionType = 'Web') SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES Here is a breakdown of how the parts of this query work: Query segment What does it do? FROM Metric Metric is one of our core data types, and metric timeslice data is stored as this data type. For general tips on querying Metric data, see Metric query examples. SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) This math generates a count of errors out of a total count of transaction metrics. This query uses the converted metric names. Note that you can use other aggregator functions. WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') You must specify at least one data source. You can select a single entity's GUID, as shown here, or you can select multiple sources. This query uses entity.guid, but you can also use appId or appName. AND (transactionType = 'Web') Sets the transaction type to web, meaning that background/non-web transactions won't be counted. SINCE 1 day ago Selecting a time range. TIMESERIES This optional clause displays the results in a time-based chart. For general information on NRQL syntax, including FROM, FACET, and TIMESERIES, see Intro to NRQL. For more queries, see Query examples. How metric timeslice data is converted The conversion of original APM metric timeslice metrics into dimensional metrics that are available for querying is an ongoing process and isn't complete. If you don't see a metric you're looking for in this section, see Generic queries. Here are how the original APM metric timeslice metrics are converted into dimensional metrics: Metric timeslice structure Dimensional metric structure APM metric names are represented as single strings of segments separated by forward slashes. For example, the “Datastore/statement/MySQL/users/select” metric represents the time spent in a select database operation on the users table. A single dimensional metric named apm.service.datastore.operation.duration represents the entire group of datastore metrics. This metric has three attributes representing the data values encoded into the metric name, datastoreType, table and operation: datastoreType = ‘MySQL’ table = ‘users’ operation = ‘select’ Some of the APM metrics made available as dimensional metrics: Metric name Description Attributes apm.service.cpu.usertime.utilization Time spent in user-mode code percentage apm.service.datastore.operation.duration Response time for database calls broken out by table operations datastoreType, table, operation apm.service.error.count Summary error count metrics transactionType apm.service.external.host.duration Response time for external calls broken out by external host name external.host apm.service.instance.count Count of the number of agent instances apm.service.memory.physical Process memory in MB apm.service.transaction.apdex Apdex scores per transaction transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.duration Response time per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.error.count Error counts per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.external.duration External call response time by transaction type transactionType Learn how to see all metrics available to you. To understand more about the general structure of metric timeslice data, including some common examples, see Metric timeslice data. Attributes These attributes are available in addition to the metric-specific attributes listed in the APM metrics table above. Name Description appName The name of the application. appId The ID of the application. entity.guid The GUID of the application. host The host of the monitored process. host.bootId The ID of the boot of the host, if available. host.displayName The display_name of the host, if it was set in the agent. instanceName For Java APM agents, host : port metricName The name of the dimensional metric. metricTimesliceName The timeslice name of the legacy metric. Generic queries with the newrelic.timeslice.value metric For metrics that haven't been converted to dimensional metrics, or for your own custom metrics, we have a dimensional metric named newrelic.timeslice.value. We recommend using the dimensional metrics from the table above when possible. When to use newrelic.timeslice.value? Given a metric timeslice name, you can query to see if it has a converted dimensional metric equivalent with this syntax: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricTimesliceName = 'Datastore/statement/MySQL/test/select' If the only metric name returned is newrelic.timeslice.value, you'll need to query your data using this general approach. Get available metrics To get a list of available metrics for an application, you can use a query like: SELECT uniques(metricTimesliceName) FROM Metric WHERE appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' AND newrelic.timeslice.value IS NOT NULL Facet on a wildcarded metric name segment Some metric timeslice names include attribute values as segments of the metric name. For example, our APM agents report metrics by tracking the duration of external calls using this format: External/{externalHost}/all Here, {externalHost} represents the host name for the outbound network call. Here's an example of a generic newrelic.timeslice.value query of a custom metric that facets on a wildcarded metric segment: FROM Metric SELECT count(newrelic.timeslice.value) WHERE appName = 'MY APP' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'Custom/Labels/{action}' TIMESERIES FACET action In this query, {action} creates a temporary attribute, action, which is then used by FACET action. You can use any name you want, because it's only an attribute that exists for the duration of the query. You should choose a name that does not conflict with an existing attribute name. Here's another example of a faceted wildcard query: This shows a NRQL query of metric timeslice data that facets the rate of Flask functions by the wildcarded process name. Recommended aggregator functions Recommended NRQL aggregator functions include: apdex average sum count rate uniques Query examples Some examples of querying metric timeslice data: Facet by multiple app names This query uses WHERE… IN to specify two applications and then facet by them: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Web throughput' WHERE appName IN ('MY_APPLICATION', 'MY_OTHER_APPLICATION') AND (transactionType = 'Web') FACET appName TIMESERIES Throughput-per-minute rate This query displays requests-per-minute chart using the rate function: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Facet by host-related attributes This query displays a requests-per-minute chart faceted by host name: FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 hours ago FACET host LIMIT 20 Instead of using host, you can facet by other host-related attributes, like host.bootId. Query of average duration of a metric This queries the average duration for a metric using average: FROM Metric SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher average duration' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder: Advanced mode is a NRQL query interface Basic mode provides a simplified query experience that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL but that uses NRQL to generate results New Relic Insights NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in both New Relic One and New Relic Insights. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction New Relic Browser events, like PageView New Relic Mobile events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by New Relic APM, Browser, and Mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the basic mode of New Relic One query builder. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by New Relic APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of Browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data, which is reported by New Relic Browser. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and Browser events over the last three days:​ SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for New Relic Browser PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.

      "body": "Most data generated by integrations is available in New Relic One dashboards, where you can query your data using NRQL and build custom dashboards. The following tips and sample queries were created for New Relic-built integrations, but most will also apply to integrations built with the Integrations SDK. For a general look at how to find and use integration data, see Understand integration data. Get started with integration data Here are some tips for finding and exploring your integration data in New Relic: From the one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services page, select an integration dashboard. There, you can view the NRQL queries that generated a chart. For examples of NRQL queries for integration data, see the example queries. Use the data explorer or the dashboards to explore and understand the available data. Read the documentation for a specific integration to learn about the reported data. When you create a useful query you'd like to add to your Insights dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric over the past day, faceted by displayName: select average('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') from BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' AND providerAccountId = '72' facet displayName TIMESERIES SINCE 1 day ago Azure Service Bus query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for the number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by name: SELECT average(activeMessages) from AzureServiceBusTopicSample TIMESERIES 5 minutes since 6 hours ago FACET displayName Azure Functions query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours: SELECT sum('functionExecutionCount.Total') FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample WHERE providerAccountId = '125' SINCE 6 hour ago TIMESERIES auto FACET displayName Azure VMs query example Here's an Insights NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT count(*) FROM AzureVirtualMachineSample SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO WHERE provider = 'AzureVirtualMachine' TIMESERIES NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in an Insights dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average('requestsPerSecond') as 'Requests' FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES until 1 minutes ago For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing active MySQL connections over time: SELECT average('connectionsActive') as 'Active Connections' FROM MysqlSample TIMESERIES until 1 minutes ago For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) from InfrastructureEvent where format='inventoryChange' facet changeType since 1 day ago You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying in New Relic Insights. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data in Insights: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data in Insights: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data in Insights: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Integration event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data in Insights: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to Insights data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found in Insights by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an Insights InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data.

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubsribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "Original user model This doc contains information about how to manage users on our original user model. Not sure which pricing plan or user model you're on? See Overview of pricing plan and user models. View and manage users To see the users on your New Relic account and their current roles: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. User types: basic user and full user On the Users and roles UI page, users are categorized as either full users or basic users. This only affects your account if you've switched to the New Relic One pricing plan, released July 2020. Once you've changed your pricing plan, the number of full users is a factor in your billing. To learn more, see Transition to new pricing. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. The Owner can also install and configure the New Relic agent, and they can enable or set up features. Admins One or more individuals who can add, edit, and delete account users. Admins can also install and configure the New Relic agent, and they can enable or set up features. Users One or more individuals who use (and optionally set up) the available New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted Users One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a master account that has sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select plus-circle New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select pencil Edit role or trash-o Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a master account with sub-accounts automatically have the same level of access for all sub-accounts. However, they will not receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for sub-accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on these sub-accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. fa-check Change the account Owner. fa-check Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. fa-check fa-check Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check Create, modify and delete sub-accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check fa-check fa-check Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. fa-check fa-check fa-check fa-check Manage flexible data retention. fa-check Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One fa-check fa-check Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure.

      "info": "Build a \"Hello, World!\" app and publish it to New Relic One",
      "body": "Create a \"Hello, World!\" application 15 min Here's how you can quickly build a \"Hello, World!\" application in New Relic One. In these steps, you create a local version of the New Relic One site where you can prototype your application. Then, when you're ready to share the application with others, you can publish it to New Relic One. See the video, which demonstrates the steps in this guide in five minutes. Before you begin To get started, make sure you have accounts in GitHub and New Relic. To develop projects, you need the New Relic One CLI (command line interface). If you haven't already installed it, do the following: Install Node.js. Complete all the steps in the CLI quick start. For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment. Tip Use the NR1 VS Code extension to build your apps. Create a local version of the \"Hello, World!\" application The CLI allows you to run a local version of New Relic One. You can develop your application locally before you publish it in New Relic One. If you followed all the steps in the CLI quick start, you now have files under a new directory named after your nerdpack project. Here's how you edit those files to create a \"Hello, World!\" project: Step 1 of 9 Open a code editor and point it to the new directory named after your nerdpack project (for example, my-awesome-nerdpack). Your code editor displays two artifacts: launchers containing the homepage tile nerdlets containing your application code Step 2 of 9 Expand nerdlets in your code editor, and open index.js. Step 3 of 9 Change the default return message to \"Hello, World!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class MyAwesomeNerdpackNerdletNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>\"Hello, World!\"</h1>; } } Copy Step 4 of 9 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image file named icon.png. Replace the default icon.png file under launcher by dragging in your new image file: Step 5 of 9 To change the name of the launcher to something meaningful, in your code editor under launchers, open nr1.json. Step 6 of 9 Change the value for displayName to anything you want as the launcher label, and save the file: { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"INSERT_YOUR_TILE_LABEL_HERE\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 7 of 9 To see your new changes locally, start the Node server with this command in your terminal: npm start Copy Step 8 of 9 Open a browser and go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local (this url is also shown in the terminal). Step 9 of 9 When the browser opens, click Apps, and then in the Other apps section, click the new launcher for your application. Here's an example where we inserted a leaf icon: After you click the new launcher, your \"Hello, World!\" appears: Publish your application to New Relic Your colleagues can't see your local application, so when you are ready to share it, publish it to the New Relic One catalog. The catalog is where you can find any pre-existing custom applications, as well as any applications you create in your own organization. Step 1 of 4 Execute the following in your terminal: nr1 nerdpack:publish Copy Step 2 of 4 Close your local New Relic One development tab, and open New Relic One. Step 3 of 4 Click the Apps launcher. Step 4 of 4 Under New Relic One catalog, click the launcher for your new application. When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any helpful descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Add details to describe your project Now that your new application is in the New Relic One catalog, you can add details that help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 5 Go to your project in the terminal and execute the following: nr1 create Copy Step 2 of 5 Select catalog, which creates a stub in your project under the catalog directory. Here's how the results might look in your code editor: Step 3 of 5 In the catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. For details about what you can add, see Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Step 4 of 5 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the catalog: nr1 catalog:submit Copy Step 5 of 5 Return to the catalog and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. Subscribe accounts to your application To make sure other users see your application in the catalog, you need to subscribe accounts to the application. Any user with the NerdPack manager or admin role can subscribe to an application from accounts that they have permission to manage. Step 1 of 3 If you're not already displaying your application's description page in the browser, click the launcher for the application in the catalog under Your company applications. Step 2 of 3 On your application's description page, click Add this app. Step 3 of 3 Select the accounts you want to subscribe to the application, and then click Update accounts to save your selections. When you return to the Apps page, you'll see the launcher for your new application. Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it. Related information Create a local application. Publish the application to the New Relic One catalog so you can share it with your colleagues. Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it. Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can see it directly on their homepage.",

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubsribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide.

      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git` cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` Copy Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID npm install # Install dependencies nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Copy Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the `nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` subdirectory and open the `index.js` file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done! Keep exploring the Table components, their properties, and how to use them, in our SDK documentation.",

      "body": "Add tables to your New Relic One application 30 min Tables are a popular way of displaying data in New Relic applications. For example, with the query builder you can create tables from NRQL queries. Whether you need to have more control over tables or you're importing third-party data, you can build your own tables into your New Relic One application. In this guide, you are going to build a sample table using various New Relic One components. Before you begin If you haven't already installed the New Relic One CLI, step through the quick start in New Relic One. This process also gets you an API key. In addition, to complete the steps in this guide, you need a GitHub account and Node.js installed on your machine. See Setting up your development environment for more info. Clone and set up the example application Step 1 of 4 Clone the nr1-how-to example application from GitHub to your local machine. Then, navigate to the app directory. The example app lets you experiment with tables. git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-how-to.git` cd nr1-how-to/create-a-table/nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` Copy Step 2 of 4 Edit the index.json file and set this.accountId to your Account ID as shown in the example. export default class Nr1HowtoAddTimePicker extends React.Component { constructor(props){ super(props) this.accountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID; } ... } Copy Step 3 of 4 Run the demo application Change the directory back to nr1-how-to/create-a-table. Before you can load the demo application, you need to update its unique id by invoking the New Relic One CLI. Once you've assigned a new UUID to the app, install the dependencies and serve the demo app locally, so that you can test any change live in your browser. nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf # Update the app unique ID npm install # Install dependencies nr1 nerdpack:serve # Serve the demo app locally Copy Step 4 of 4 Open one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local in your browser. Click Apps, and then in the Your apps section, you should see a Create a table launcher. That's the demo application you're going to work on. Go ahead and select it. Have a good look at the demo app. There's a TableChart on the left side named Transaction Overview, with an AreaChart next to it. You'll use Table components to add a new table in the second row. Work with table components Step 1 of 10 Navigate to the `nerdlets/create-a-table-nerdlet` subdirectory and open the `index.js` file. Add the following components to the import statement at the top of the file so that it looks like the example: Table TableHeader TableHeaderCell TableRow TableRowCell import { Table, TableHeader, TableHeaderCell, TableRow, TableRowCell, PlatformStateContext, Grid, GridItem, HeadingText, AreaChart, TableChart, } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 10 Add a basic Table component Locate the empty GridItem in index.js: This is where you start building the table. Add the initial <Table> component. The items property collects the data by calling _getItems(), which contains sample values. <GridItem className=\"primary-content-container\" columnSpan={12}> <Table items={this._getItems()}></Table> </GridItem>; Copy Step 3 of 10 Add the header and rows As the Table component renders a fixed number of header cells and rows, your next step is adding header components, as well as a function that returns the required table rows. Inside of the Table component, add the TableHeader and then a TableHeaderCell child for each heading. Since you don't know how many rows you'll need, your best bet is to call a function to build as many TableRows as items returned by _getItems(). <TableHeader> <TableHeaderCell>Application</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Size</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Company</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Team</TableHeaderCell> <TableHeaderCell>Commit</TableHeaderCell> </TableHeader>; { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <TableRowCell>{item.name}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.value}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 4 of 10 Take a look at the application running in New Relic One: you should see something similar to the screenshot below. Step 5 of 10 Replace standard table cells with smart cells The New Relic One library includes cell components that can automatically format certain data types, like users, metrics, and entity names. The table you've just created contains columns that can benefit from those components: Application (an entity name) and Size (a metric). Before you can use EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell, you have to add them to the import statement first. import { EntityTitleTableRowCell, MetricTableRowCell, ... /* All previous components */ } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 6 of 10 Update your table rows by replacing the first and second TableRowCells with entity and metric cells. Notice that EntityTitleTableRowCell and MetricTableRowCell are self-closing tags. { ({ item }) => ( <TableRow> <EntityTitleTableRowCell value={item} /> <MetricTableRowCell type={MetricTableRowCell.TYPE.APDEX} value={item.value} /> <TableRowCell>{item.company}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.team}</TableRowCell> <TableRowCell>{item.commit}</TableRowCell> </TableRow> ); } Copy Step 7 of 10 Time to give your table a second look: The cell components you've added take care of properly formatting the data. Step 8 of 10 Add some action to your table! Tables are great, but interactive tables can be better: As a last update, you are going to allow users to act on each data row. Add the _getActions() method to your index.js file, right before _getItems(). As you may have guessed from the code, _getActions() spawns an alert box when you click Team or Commit cells. _getActions() { return [ { label: 'Alert Team', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__ALERT, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Alert Team: ${item.team}`); }, }, { label: 'Rollback Version', iconType: TableRow.ACTIONS_ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__UNDO, onClick: (evt, { item, index }) => { alert(`Rollback from: ${item.commit}`); }, }, ]; } Copy Step 9 of 10 Find the TableRow component in your return statement and point the actions property to _getActions(). The TableRow actions property defines a set of actions that appear when the user hovers over a table row. Actions have a mandatory text and an onClick callback, but can also display an icon or be disabled if needed. <TableRow actions={this._getActions()}> Copy Step 10 of 10 Go back to your application and try hovering over any of the rows: Notice how the two available actions appear. When you click them, a function triggers with the selected row data as an argument, and an alert displays in your browser. Next steps You've built a table into a New Relic One application, using components to format data automatically and provide contextual actions. Well done! Keep exploring the Table components, their properties, and how to use them, in our SDK documentation.",

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubsribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "Add, query, and mutate data using NerdStorage 45 min NerdStorage is a document database accessible within New Relic One. It allows you to modify, save, and retrieve documents from one session to the next. Using NerdStorage, you can create individual documents of up to 64kb in size, create different collections of documents, and store data by entity, account, or user level. This guide explains how to add data and documents to NerdStorage. For an introduction to what NerdStorage is and how it works, see Intro to NerdStorage. Before you begin This guide requires that you have an API key and the New Relic One CLI as described in Set up your development environment. Get started First, get the NerdStorage app running successfully inside New Relic One. Step 1 of 3 Clone the example applications from the GitHub repo. Step 2 of 3 Use the New Relic One CLI to update the application UUID and run the application locally. In the terminal, switch to the /nr1-how-to/use-nerdstorage directory: cd / nr1 - how - to / use - nerdstorage; Copy Update the UUID and serve the application: nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 3 Once the app is successfully served, your terminal will return the URL to view your running application on New Relic One. Load the URL. Click Apps and under Your apps you'll see the Use Nerdstorage app listed. Click to launch the app. Add data to NerdStorage Once the app is up and running on New Relic One, you can prepare the app and start adding data. On the How To Use NerdStorage app screen, there's a Saved to NerdStorage pane with a field for adding data. However, if you type something you'll get an error message. This is because you need to be set up to store data at the User level. You can do this with the help of the UserStorageMutation component. Step 1 of 3 Open the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file in the text editor of your choice and find the code for the TextField and Button used to enter data. The Button onClick prop makes a call to a helper method called _addToNerdStorage, and you need to update it to add UserStorageMutation The UserStorage NerdStorage components require a collection and documentId. In the constructor method in the application’s index.js file, you can see the variables being provided. In the .js file, it will look something like this: constructor(props) { super(props) this.collectionId = 'mycollection'; this.documentId = 'learning-nerdstorage'; this.state = { isOpen: true, storage: [], text: '', }; this._addToNerdStorage = this._addToNerdStorage.bind(this); this._removeFromNerdStorage = this._removeFromNerdStorage.bind(this); this._deleteDocument = this._deleteDocument.bind(this); } Copy Step 2 of 3 Import the UserStorageMutation by adding it to your import statement at the top of the index.js file: import { UserStorageMutation } from 'nr1'; Copy Then update the helper with this code beginning with _addToNerdStorage: _addToNerdStorage(){ const { text, storage } = this.state; storage.push(text); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { this.setState({text: ''}); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Return to your running How To Use NerdStorage app screen on New Relic One and reload the page. Add some text in the text entry field and click the check button. This will update NerdStorage and trigger a Toast notification inside the app. You should then see the text you typed displayed as a table row below the text entry field. Query data from NerdStorage Once you get data storage working as described in the section above, you also need to get the app properly reading data from NerdStorage, or the app will reload with an empty state every time you navigate away from the app page and back. To do this, add the UserStorageQuery component and update the componentDidMount method. Step 1 of 3 Import the UserStorageQuery by adding it to the import statement in the application’s ./nerdlets/use-nerdstorage-nerdlet/index.js file. import { UserStorageMutation, UserStorageQuery } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Then, add the following componentDidMount method to your application: componentDidMount(){ UserStorageQuery.query({ collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }) .then(({ data }) => { if(data !== null) { this.setState({storage: data.storage}); } }) .catch(err => console.log(err)); } Copy Step 3 of 3 Back inside the NerdStorage app, test your changes by adding a few more rows using the text entry field. Then exit and relaunch the application. The application should load and show all the data you entered before you navigated away. Mutate data in NerdStorage Each NerdStorage entry displayed in the table inside the app has a trash button that can be used to update a specific entry. The trash button works by making a call to the _removeFromNerdStorage helper method. Step 1 of 1 To get this process working, update the code in _removeFromNerdStorage: _removeFromNerdStorage(index, data){ const { storage } = this.state; storage.pop(data); this.setState({storage}, () => { UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.WRITE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, document: { storage }, }) .then((res) => { Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.NORMAL }); }) .catch((err) => console.log(err)); }); } Copy Once you do this, clicking the trash button removes the item it's associated with, and the app updates to show the change. Delete collection from NerdStorage While the trash button is a good method for removing specific entries one at a time, you may also want the ability to delete a whole NerdStorage document at once. You can do this by adding the Delete Document button to your app. Step 1 of 2 Add a new GridItem to the application immediately before the closing Grid tag. In the new GridItem add the following code to display your new button: <Button onClick={() => this._deleteDocument()} type={Button.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE} sizeType={Button.SIZE_TYPE.SMALL} iconType={Button.ICON_TYPE.INTERFACE__OPERATIONS__TRASH} > Delete Document </Button>; Copy Step 2 of 2 Because the new Delete Document button will be calling the _deleteDocument helper method, you'll need to update that using this code: _deleteDocument(){ this.setState({storage: []}); UserStorageMutation.mutate({ actionType: UserStorageMutation.ACTION_TYPE.DELETE_DOCUMENT, collection: this.collectionId, documentId: this.documentId, }); Toast.showToast({ title: \"NerdStorage Update.\", type: Toast.TYPE.CRITICAL }); } Copy Back inside the application, you should now see both the individual trash buttons and the newly added Delete Document button.

      "body": "Nerdpack file structure A New Relic One application is represented by a Nerdpack folder, which can include one or more Nerdlet files, and (optionally) one or more launcher files. Here we explain: The file structure for a Nerdpack, a Nerdlet, and a launcher How to link a launcher file to a Nerdlet How to link your application with a monitored entity For basic component definitions, see our component reference. Generate Nerdpack components There are two ways to generate a Nerdpack template: Generate a Nerdpack: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and select Nerdpack to create a Nerdpack template that includes a Nerdlet and a launcher. Generate Nerdlet or launcher individually: Use the New Relic One CLI command nr1 create and choose either Nerdlet or launcher. This can be useful when adding Nerdlets to an existing Nerdpack. For documentation on generating and connecting Nerdpack components, see our app building guides and the New Relic One CLI command reference. Nerdpack file structure When you generate a Nerdpack template using the nr1 create command, it has the following file structure: my-nerdlet ├── README.md ├── launchers │   └── my-nerdlet-launcher │   ├── icon.png │   └── nr1.json ├── nerdlets │   └── my-nerdlet-nerdlet │   ├── index.js │   ├── nr1.json │   └── styles.scss ├── node_modules │   ├── js-tokens │   ├── loose-envify │   ├── object-assign │   ├── prop-types │   ├── react │   ├── react-dom │   ├── react-is │   └── scheduler ├── nr1.json ├── package-lock.json └── package.json Copy Nerdlet file structure A Nerdpack can contain one or more Nerdlets. A Nerdlet folder starts out with three default files, index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. Here is what the default files look like after being generated using the nr1 create command: index.js The JavaScript code of the Nerdlet. import React from 'react'; export default class MyAwesomeNerdpack extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, my-awesome-nerdpack Nerdlet!</h1>; } } Copy nr1.json The Nerdlet configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\" } Copy Besides using the launcher as the access point for your application, you can also associate the application with a monitored entity to get it to appear in the entity explorer. To do this, add two additional fields to the config file of the first-launched Nerdlet: entities and actionCategory. In the following example, the Nerdlet has been associated with all Browser-monitored applications and will appear under the Monitor UI category : { \"schemaType\": \"NERDLET\", \"id\": \"my-nerdlet\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Custom Data\", \"entities\": [{ \"domain\": \"BROWSER\", \"type\": \"APPLICATION\" }], \"actionCategory\": \"monitor\" } Copy To see this application in the UI, you would go to the entity explorer, select Browser applications, and select a monitored application. styles.scss An empty SCSS file for styling your application. icon.png The launcher icon that appears on the Apps page in New Relic One when an application is deployed. Launcher file structure Launchers have their own file structure. Note that: A launcher is not required; as an alternative to using a launcher, you can associate your application with a monitored entity. An application can have more than one launcher, which might be desired for an application with multiple Nerdlets. After generating a launcher using the nr1 create command, its folder contains two files: nr1.json The configuration file. { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"MyAwesomeNerdpack\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy To connect a launcher to a Nerdlet, the rootNerdletId must match the id in the launched Nerdlet's nr1.json config file. For Nerdpacks with multiple Nerdlets, this needs to be done only for the first-launched Nerdlet. icon.png The icon displayed on the launcher for the app on the Apps page.",

      "body": "This document contains tutorials on how to use NerdGraph to programmatically create and manage several types of New Relic keys. To build queries and see responses, use our GraphiQL explorer. For more information on our API keys, see API keys. Feature description NerdGraph's ApiAccess field can be used to programmatically create and manage the following types of keys: Personal API keys License keys, including: General license key used for APM Browser license key One common use case for this feature is the ability to create and manage license keys to let you rotate keys for security purposes. Note that you can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. General notes about this functionality: All mutations can accept multiple keys as arguments, and will return details about successful changes and errors. See examples below for details. All mutations (create, update and delete) will result in an NrAuditEvent that can be queried for auditing purposes. For details, see Audit events. Some notes about license keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, the license keys are referred to as ingest keys. This feature allows you to create up to 1,000 keys of each license key type, which allows for key rotation. You can't use this NerdGraph functionality to manage or delete your original license keys; you can only create additional license keys and manage the ones you've created. License keys created through NerdGraph can't be found in the New Relic UI. They're only queryable via the API. Some notes about personal API keys: In the context of using NerdGraph, personal API keys are referred to as user keys. User keys are displayed in various UI locations (for example: the User settings UI page). The examples below use license keys (ingest keys), but personal API keys (user keys) are queried in similar ways. We recommend you experiment with queries using the GraphiQL explorer. Create keys You can create multiple keys in a single mutation, for multiple accounts and key types. Note that the mutation can return successfully created keys as well as any errors encountered trying to create keys. Example of creating a key: mutation { apiAccessCreateKeys(keys: {ingest: {accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, ingestType: BROWSER, name: \"Browser Key\", notes: \"A note.\"}}) { createdKeys { id key name accountId notes type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } errors { message type ... on ApiAccessIngestKeyError { accountId errorType ingestType } } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Update keys The update mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. mutation { apiAccessUpdateKeys(keys: {ingest: {keyId: KEY_ID, name: \"Updated name\", notes: \"A new note!\"}}) { updatedKeys { id key type name notes } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Delete keys The delete mutation takes the key ID, not the key string, to identify keys. Deleted keys will no longer grant access to New Relic systems and will no longer be returned by queries to the API access GraphQL API. mutation { apiAccessDeleteKeys(keys: {ingestKeyIds: INGEST_KEY_ID}) { deletedKeys { id } errors { message } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries. Query keys You can access ingest and user keys by querying a single key or all keys, scoped to the actor. If querying for a single key, you must provide the key ID and type (INGEST or USER). Querying for multiple keys is done via a key search, which uses a mandatory types list and an optional scope to filter results. User keys belonging to other users will be obfuscated in the results. Single key example query: query { actor { apiAccess { key(id: INGEST_KEY_ID, keyType: INGEST) { key name type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } Key search example query: query { actor { apiAccess { keySearch(query: {types: INGEST, scope: {ingestTypes: BROWSER}}) { keys { name key type ... on ApiAccessIngestKey { ingestType } } } } } } Results will vary depending on your data. Use the GraphiQL explorer to experiment with mutations and queries.

See Overview of pricing plans. New Relic provides an events-to-metrics service that lets you generate metric-type data from your event-type data. Metrics are aggregates of your event data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from event data? Historically for New Relic, NRQL queries and the resulting charts were created only with event-type data. With the new events-to-metrics feature, you can create metrics from your event data and create queries and charts from those metrics. Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage, which in turn allows for faster, more efficient data queries and chart-builds. Here's an explanation of these two types of data: Events: Event data represents a record of a single event at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your event data. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you could aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this month-over-month. For more on how metrics and events are different, see Understand data types. Note that creating metrics from events will not delete events; this feature creates metrics from the event data without altering the events. More details on what makes metrics unique and better for longer-range querying/charting: Metrics are dimensional; you get to choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated Data retention is 13 months. Metrics are queryable using the Metric event type. Start creating an events-to-metrics rule. Available operations To perform events-to-metrics operations, you'll use NerdGraph, which is our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. The events-to-metrics feature’s operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new events-to-metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing events-to-metrics rules). All metrics-to-events operations are role-based. When performed via NerdGraph, they'll be made under the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations include: Create an events-to-metrics rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Here's an example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Let's look at some elements of this request: mutation: one of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule: The method being called to delete a rule. deletes takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the events-to-metrics rule. accountId: The New Relic account ID. In the successes and submitted blocks, you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (ruleId for submitted), name, description, nrql, enabled, and accountId. Here's an example response for the above example request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Enable/disable a rule This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To disable or enable an existing events-to-metrics rule, you use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation, with the only difference being whether enabled is set to true or false Here's an example request for enabling an existing events-to-metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Let's go through some elements of this request: mutation: one of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule: The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the events-to-metrics rule. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. In the successes and submitted blocks, you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can choose to list all rules in a New Relic account, or return a specific rule. Below is an example of listing of all rules for an account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Let's go through some elements of this request: query: one of the basic API operation types, used for querying but not making changes. actor: This specifies the current user. account(id: 123456): Specify the ID for the New Relic account to retrieve data from. eventsToMetrics: Scope the data to only events-to-metrics rules. allRules: Returns all rules for that account. rules: In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Here's an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now want to list its contents to review it. Below is an example listing rule number 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } For more detail about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Here's an example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure, and to build and run the events-to-metrics operations. To use this tool: Once you have an operation's request created with the required parameters, go to the GraphiQL API tool and paste your query into the box on the left. Execute the operation by pressing Play. (Optionally, you can get the cURL format by selecting Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box on the right side. If you'd like to verify a rule-creation operation was performed successfully, you can run a list query for that rule ID.

      "body": "This document provides examples of how to use New Relic NerdGraph to query and modify your cloud integration configuration data, including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer, you can also query NRQL data. These examples for querying cloud integration configuration data use GraphQL queries and mutations: Queries: requests that are intended to only fetch data Mutations: requests that create or update data on the server Requirements Before querying cloud integration data with NerdGraph, ensure you have: Followed the instructions to connect cloud integrations with New Relic. Created an API key. Access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer To access the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer: Go to https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Add any of the following examples. Query examples Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). Queries in NerdGraph are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Available provider accounts This query returns a list of all provider accounts available in your infrastructure data. Depending on the provider, additional properties can be requested. For example, for GCP, you can also ask for the serviceAccountId property, which is needed when linking a new GCP project to New Relic. Anonymous: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug ... on CloudGcpProvider { serviceAccountId } } } } } } Named: query cloudProviders { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } } } } } Specific provider account information This query returns information about a specific provider account for your Amazon AWS integration. The properties id, name, slug are requested, along with a list of integrations available to be monitored. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { id slug name services { id slug name } } } } } } Specific integration data from a specific cloud provider This query returns information about a specific cloud service integration of a provider. In this example, the integration is the Amazon AWS ALB monitoring integration and the provider is AWS. The properties id, name, slug, and isAllowed are requested with the available configuration parameters. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { provider(slug: \"aws\") { service(slug: \"alb\") { id name slug isEnabled } } } } } } List of enabled cloud accounts This query returns the list of cloud accounts enabled with your New Relic account. (Your cloud account associates your New Relic account and a specific provider account with your integration.) You can enable multiple cloud provider accounts in the same New Relic account, even with the same cloud provider. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { id name createdAt provider { id name } } } } } } Specific linked account data This query returns information about a linked account, including the properties name, providerId, and a list of the cloud integrations enabled for monitoring. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integrations { id name createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Enabled cloud integrations for all linked accounts This query returns all monitored integrations for all the provider cloud accounts. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccounts { name provider { id name } integrations { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Specific cloud integration data for a specific linked account This query returns information about a specific integration from a specific linked account. { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { linkedAccount(id: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>) { name provider { id name } integration(id: <INTEGRATION_ID>) { id name service { id name } createdAt updatedAt } } } } } } Mutation examples Mutations are requests that are intended to have side effects, such as creating or updating data on the server. Mutations require the keyword mutation and the name of the mutation. NerdGraph mutations are restricted to a subset of all possible mutations. Link an account This mutation allows linking cloud provider accounts to a New Relic account, creating one or more linked accounts. It can link one specific cloud provider account (for example aws) to the New Relic account or multiple cloud provider accounts to one New Relic account. Required: The parameter <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME> is required and cannot be empty. It must be unique in your New Relic account. Other parameters are specific to the provider (AWS, GCP, and Azure) and are also required. In the following sections, you can see which parameters are required for each provider account. After linking an account the createdAt and updatedAt values are equal. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accounts: { accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, <other_params> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Link an Amazon AWS account This mutation links an Amazon AWS provider account to your New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } } Link a Microsoft Azure account This mutation links a Microsoft Azure cloud subscription to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { azure: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, applicationId: <azure_application_id>, clientSecret: <azure_application_key>, tenantId: <azure_tenant_id>, subscriptionId: <azure_subscription_id> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Link a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project This mutation links a GCP project to the New Relic account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { gcp: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, projectId: <GCP_PROJECT_ID> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } } } Rename one or more cloud accounts This mutation allows you to rename one or more linked provider accounts. The name parameter is required, cannot be empty, and must be unique within your New Relic account. mutation { cloudRenameAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: [ { id: <linked_account_id_1>, name: <new_provider_account_name> }, { id: <linked_account_id_2>, name: <new_provider_account_name> } ] ) { linkedAccounts { id name } } } Enable an integration in a cloud account This mutation allows you to enable the monitoring of one or more specific cloud integrations in an existing cloud account. With this mutation, New Relic records data for the enabled integration from the provider account. For each provider account you have access to different input parameters, matching each available service. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, <other_parameters> }] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Enable an integration in multiple cloud accounts If you have many provider accounts linked, you can enable the same integration in the many cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug> : { <integration_slug> : [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_2> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name integration { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Enable multiple integrations in multiple cloud accounts If you have multiple cloud accounts linked, you can also enable multiple integrations in multiple linked cloud accounts at the same time. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug_1>: { <integration_slug_1>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_1> } ] <integration_slug_2>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_2> } ] }, <provider_slug_2>: { <integration_slug_3>: [ { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_3>}, { linkedAccountId: <linked_account_id_4>} ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } ... on SqsIntegration { awsRegions } } } } Modify an integration's configuration (regions, polling intervals, etc.) This mutation also allows you to modify one or more cloud integrations and change one or more configuration parameters. Each service will have specific parameters that you can modify. For parameters of a type list (for example, awsRegion) supply the full list. For the output of the operation, you can use GraphQL fragments to ask for integration specific configuration parameters. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { <provider_slug>: { <integration_slug>: [{ linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: <new_polling_interval>, <parameter_1>: <value_1>, <parameter_N>: <value_N>, }] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval, <parameter_1>, <parameter_N> } } errors { type message } } } Disable (remove) an integration This mutation allows you to disable an integration and stop data collection for the specific cloud integration. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { : { : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id name authLabel provider { id } } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Unlink account This mutation allows you to unlink cloud provider accounts from New Relic account. This action can not be undone. However, you can link the account again, but account history will still be lost. mutation { cloudUnlinkAccount ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } } ) { unlinkedAccounts { id name } errors { type message } } }</integration_slug></provider_slug> Enable an Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To enable an Amazon AWS integration: Send query to fetch account data Send a query to fetch data about the account, specifically available providers and already created provider accounts: { actor { account(id: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>) { cloud { providers { id name slug } linkedAccounts { name integrations { id name } } } } } } Link AWS provider account Link an AWS provider account, if there is not one already linked or if you want to link another AWS account: Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter. Provide a name for the provider account in the <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>. Include the ARN of the AWS role used to fetch data from your AWS account. mutation { cloudLinkAccount( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, accounts: { aws: [{ name: <PROVIDER_ACCOUNT_NAME>, arn: <AWS_ROLE_ARN> }] } ) { linkedAccounts { id name authLabel createdAt updatedAt } errors { type message } } } Enable Amazon AWS SQS integration Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Enable integration in multiple provider accounts If you have multiple accounts with the same provider account, you can enable the same integration in multiple provider accounts at the same time. Use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the provider accounts in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_n> parameter value. mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_1> }, { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID_2>, configuration_param_1: value_1, configuration_param_2: value_2 } ] } } }) { integrations { id name service { id name } } errors { type message } } } Change polling interval for Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To change the polling interval of an AWS integration: Update the polling interval To update the polling interval for an Amazon AWS SQS integration, use your New Relic account ID in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the id of the linked provider account in the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value: mutation { cloudConfigureIntegration( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws : { sqs: [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID>, metricsPollingInterval: 300 } ] } } ) { integrations { id name service { id slug } ... on SqsIntegration { metricsPollingInterval } } errors { type message } } } Disable Amazon AWS integration This example uses an Amazon AWS SQS integration and assumes you have connected an AWS account to New Relic. To disable an AWS integration: Disable the SQS integration Use your New Relic account identifier in the <NR_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter and the ID of the linked cloud account the <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> parameter value. mutation { cloudDisableIntegration ( accountId: <NR_ACCOUNT_ID>, integrations: { aws: { sqs : [ { linkedAccountId: <LINKED_ACCOUNT_ID> } ] } } ) { disabledIntegrations { id accountId name } errors { type message } } } For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "You can create alert conditions using NRQL queries. Create NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition: When you start to create a condition, where it prompts you to Select a product, click NRQL. Tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For some condition types, you can create a Description. Query results Queries must return a number. The condition works by evaluating that returned number against the thresholds you set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Configure whether and how open violations are force-closed. Adjust the evaluation offset. Create a concise and descriptive condition name. (NerdGraph API Only) Provide a text description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Troubleshooting procedures Optional: To include your organization's procedures for handling the incident, add the runbook URL to the condition. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions do not affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you cannot use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. NRQL alert syntax Here is the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. Depending on the threshold type, also include a FACET clause as applicable. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Optional Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Static: Optional Baseline: Not allowed Outlier: Required Including a FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depends on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than this number of values, the alert condition cannot be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of the one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum, and the preview chart will update accordingly. Offset the query time window Every minute, we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows. The start time depends on the value you select in the NRQL condition's Advanced settings > Evaluation offset. Example: Using the default time window to evaluate violations With the Evaluation offset at the default setting of three minutes, the NRQL time window applied to your query will be: SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago If the event type is sourced from an APM language agent and aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend evaluating data from three minutes ago or longer. An offset of less than 3 minutes will trigger violations sooner, but you might see more false positives and negatives due to data latency. For cloud data, such as AWS integrations, you may need an offset longer than 3 minutes. Check our AWS polling intervals documentation to determine your best setting. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Create a description You can define a description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by downstream systems.

You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic One entity explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

Distributed tracing Distributed tracing plays a very important role in the troubleshooting experience since it lets you dig into the communication pipe between the AWS Lambda function and any other artifact that function talks to during its execution. Distributed tracing also gives you valuable information regarding what each transaction is about, the time it takes to complete, and if there were errors. Inventoried Tags and Metadata We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Facet Builder New Relic’s Facet Builder for AWS Lambda instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom insights—without having to write queries. Metrics, events, and other measurement High cardinality invocation data View throughput, detailed categorized AWS Lambda performance metrics like duration, cold starts, error rate and more at any transaction percentile. Filter and facet by tags and function metadata to rapidly find the answer you’re looking for. AWS CloudWatch Metrics We capture metrics harvested from AWS CloudWatch for over 30 connected AWS services including AWS Lambda, allowing you to understand the performance of event-driven architectures that include queues and data streams. Key event AWS Lambda metrics like iterator age, dead letter errors / dead letter queue depth, and throttles can be visualized along performance data from instrumentation in your functions. Custom attributes and custom events Capture and send custom attributes or events and tag their function invocations with attributes, so you can connect your performance data to specific business KPIs, or understand the performance of specific functionality within your function. Errors and alerts Rich error analysis View all the errors that occurred in your function code and analyze all the details and error traces. Use agent APIs to define custom errors, even when your function runs as expected. Rich alert ecosystem Build alerts using NRQL, allowing you to drive alerts based on custom attributes or any function-specific attribute.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data, which is then available for querying in New Relic. Related documentation: Add custom attributes to existing events Send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM) Custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Data considerations The New Relic agents sends event data to New Relic as part of its normal harvest cycle every 5 seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 10,000 custom events per minute. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record a custom event To record a custom event, follow the procedure for your New Relic language agent: C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml:​ custom_insights_events: enabled: false For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see Limits and restricted characters and Reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.

      "body": "Collect data from any source 15 min New Relic products report a lot of data “out of the box.” When you use products like APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure monitoring, or an integration, by default you receive performance data. But you may want to bring data into New Relic that isn't collected by default. Maybe you want an API-based solution that doesn't require install of an agent. Maybe you want to bring telemetry data from another analysis service into New Relic. This page describes several ways to get data into New Relic. Step 1 of 6 Agent APIs If you use our APM, Browser, or Mobile agents to report data, you can use their associated APIs to report custom data. For example, if you monitor your application with the our APM Python agent, you can use the Python agent API to set up custom instrumentation. See the agent APIs. Step 2 of 6 Telemetry SDK Our Telemetry SDKs are language wrappers for our Trace API and Metric API (and eventually our Log API and Event API). These SDKs let you easily send metrics and trace data to New Relic without needing to install an agent. For customers, we offer open-source exporters and integrations that use the Telemetry SDKs to send metrics and trace data: Istio adaptor Prometheus OpenMetrics (for Docker | for Kubernetes) OpenCensus exporter (for Go | for Python) DropWizard exporter Micrometer exporter Want to build your own solution? See our Telemetry SDK docs. Step 3 of 6 Trace API Our Trace API lets you send distributed tracing data to New Relic and consolidate tracing data from multiple sources in one place. We accept trace data in two formats: Zipkin format New Relic format (if you don’t have Zipkin-format data, you’d use this) 1 curl -i -X POST https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \\ 5 -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \\ 6 -d '[ 7 { 8 \"common\": { 9 \"attributes\": { 10 \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", 11 \"host\": \"host123.test.com\" 12 } 13 }, 14 \"spans\": [ 15 { 16 \"trace.id\": \"123456\", 17 \"id\": \"ABC\", 18 \"attributes\": { 19 \"duration.ms\": 12.53, 20 \"name\": \"/home\" 21 } 22 }, 23 { 24 \"trace.id\": \"123456\", 25 \"id\": \"DEF\", 26 \"attributes\": { 27 \"service.name\": \"Test Service A\", 28 \"host\": \"host456.test.com\", 29 \"duration.ms\": 2.97, 30 \"name\": \"/auth\", 31 \"parent.id\": \"ABC\" 32 } 33 } 34 ] 35 } 36 ]' Copy Step 4 of 6 Metric API You can use our Metric API to send metric data to New Relic from any source. 1 curl -i -X POST https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 { 6 \"metrics\": [ 7 { 8 \"name\": \"memory.heap\", 9 \"type\": \"gauge\", 10 \"value\": 2.3, 11 \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, 12 \"attributes\": { 13 \"host.name\": \"dev.server.com\" 14 } 15 } 16 ] 17 } 18 ]' Copy Step 5 of 6 Event API For sending arbitrary events to New Relic, you can use our Event API. We save these events as a new event type, which can then be queried via NRQL. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Event API.) 1 curl -i -X POST https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/events \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"x-insert-key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 { 6 \"eventType\": \"LoginEvent\", 7 \"service\": \"login-service\", 8 \"customerId\": \"xyz\" 9 } 10 ]' Copy Step 6 of 6 Log API If our existing logging integrations don’t meet your needs, you can use our Log API to send any arbitrary log data to New Relic. (Eventually, the Telemetry SDKs will support the Log API.) 1 curl -i -X POST https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 \\ 2 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ 3 -H \"Api-Key: $INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY\" \\ 4 -d '[ 5 \"logs\": [ 6 { 7 \"timestamp\": 1593538496000, 8 \"message\": \"User xyz logged in\", 9 \"service\": \"login-service\", 10 \"hostname\": \"login.example.com\" 11 } 12 ] 13 ]' Copy",

Watch your data streaming in from New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation in one place. Sign up for free Request a demo Data Sources Data Analysis Data Presentation Integrations Data Sources New Relic offers the ability to automatically stream your data from New Relic agents (APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure) and 3rd party instrumentation (Prometheus, DropWizard, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Fluentd, and more!) for deeper analysis, segmentation, and filtering. Leverage your New Relic data You're already receiving the raw data that powers the out-of-the-box views you see in our products. You can customize and create dashboards and visualizations to focus in on the data you want to see, and answer your key questions about application performance and customer experience—all in real-time. APM: Transactions By default, New Relic APM agents send transactions, transaction errors, and spans to New Relic Database. Transaction events includes information about your app, database calls, the duration of the transaction, and any errors that may occur. Transaction errors occur when a request throws an exception in the code's path that was taken to fill a request. New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation create spans when an individual unit of work is done in a distributed system. You can also add custom attributes to existing events or add custom events using the language agent APIs. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticCheck Every time a synthetic check is run off a given monitor, we track a SyntheticCheck request. For every Synthetics monitor you have, you can sort your analysis for the most common errors and most frequent error messages, pinpointing issues in your application. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticRequest We create a SyntheticRequest event when we receive a response from your web application for a check we run. Analyze application activity by response code, determine which third party services are slowing your website down, and uncover the content taking up the majority of your page load time. Learn more. Browser: PageView A PageView event is recorded when your web application has a page load and the New Relic Browser agent fires. Analyze detailed statistics on browser type and version usage for your customers, understand how different geographic regions are performing, and create detailed user journeys based on the PageViews from a single session. Learn more. Mobile: MobileSession A MobileSession event begins when any user starts your app. Understand how users are adopting your application and the key screens that they spend time on. Learn which devices and models your team needs to support. Track core mobile KPIs on user activity and engagement. Learn more. Open instrumentation: Metrics, Traces, and Logs New Relic’s open platform allows you to send virtually any telemetry data from in-house, open source, and vendor-agnostic tools to display that information alongside all the other systems and services data you’re managing. Use pre-built exporters and our telemetry SDKs to send metrics from Prometheus, DropWizard, and Micrometer (and more), traces using Zipkin, and logs from Fluentd, fluentbit, and other open source tools. Or send other telemetry data directly to our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API. Add your own business data Providing customers with the ability to aggregate, filter, segment, and combine unique sets of their New Relic data is just the start. To take your application performance analysis to the next level, it’s critical that you add your own content to your data. In New Relic, you can do that in two ways; by enriching an existing data stream with custom attributes, or by importing data from other data sources. Custom attributes Add important context to your existing data with custom attributes. By adding one line of code to your application, you can track useful information such as customer or account ID. After adding this single attribute, you'll be able to segment your performance data by customer or account, and understand the exact performance, issues, errors, and features that customer is experiencing. Learn more about implementing and leveraging custom attributes. Custom events Import data in JSON format to our Event API, and analyze that data in New Relic. A common example of using the custom events API is to import additional datasets alongside data that New Relic agents capture natively for deeper analysis. While some use cases have centered around tracking infrastructure performance, server metrics, or more detailed user analytics, there are also a variety of customers using custom events and New Relic dashboards as a general toolset for real-time analytics. Some of our customers pull in data from other business and technical systems completely independent of application performance. Custom logs Beyond providing granular log visibility for New Relic sources, customers can also ingest and analyze any text-based data originating on-prem or in the cloud to troubleshoot incidents and reduce the mean time to resolution (MTTR). Data Analysis New Relic dashboards give you a powerful array of capabilities and visualizations for analyzing your data in real-time. The main method of querying data in New Relic is via our SQL-flavored language, New Relic Query Language (NRQL). All of the visualizations, analyses and capabilities below are leveraged via NRQL. For details on how to use these different features, refer to our NRQL documentaiton. Visual Data Explorer Explore your data, visually, with a point, click, and search interface for creating charts and analyses in seconds. Understand the types of data captured within New Relic by sampling individual metrics, events, logs, and traces. Grab the auto-generated NRQL to quickly copy and modify it to take your analysis to the next level. Heatmaps Go beyond histograms and create a heatmap by segmenting your histogram by device, geography, browser, or any other aspect of your data. Basics Visualizations Use out-of-the-box visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and numbers widgets to discover trends in your data. Funnels Determine whether low conversion rates at various stages of your funnel (eg, sign up, checkout, or subscribe) are impacted by different levels of performance. Cohorts Create a cohort analysis for your users, and understand how different sets of users engage with your application based on time of day, month, or year. Segmentation Segment your application data in a variety of ways based on default attributes or attributes you add. Histograms Track a performance histogram of any duration metric for a given transaction, pageview, or group of application activity. Filters and linking Create powerful filters that can be applied to any dashboard. You can also use this feature to link multiple dashboards together, creating drill down reports for non-technical users. Data Presentation Whether you need to present a variety of metrics and visualizations in a meeting or on the go, embed charts into your own application, or create self-service dashboards for other teams. Dashboards Dashboards are the most common method of sharing important data stored in New Relic, giving you a simple way to create purpose-specific reports that can be shared in meetings or a heads-up display on a monitor. Whether providing customer support with the ability to understand customer activity around an error or crash, or giving the product team a simple way to understand engagement with top features, dashboards provide a simple, yet powerful, way to share the wealth of data accessible within New Relic. Learn more. Embedded Charts For a real-time view of your telemetry data within your own internal- or customer-facing reporting solutions, New Relic allows you to embed any data widget. And your queries will continue to run and load data in real-time, keeping data consumers up-to-date. Learn more. Mobile App New Relic's mobile app allows you to access any of your dashboards and reports on the go. Our beautiful visualizations are accessible at any time, when you need them, or if you just want to show off your killer metrics. Download New Relic for your iPhone.

      "body": "New Relic products report a variety of default event data to your account. This document will explain how to report your own custom events and attributes. Overview of reporting custom events and attributes Event data is one of the fundamental New Relic data types. Events are reported by most New Relic products, and we give you several options for reporting your own custom events. Reporting custom events allows you to create more useful and customized queries and charts of your data, and is a key part of optimizing how New Relic works for you. Before beginning, it's important to know that reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance, or cause you to approach or pass data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the Browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via Browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetics Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools.

Watch your data streaming in from New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation in one place. Sign up for free Request a demo Data Sources Data Analysis Data Presentation Integrations Data Sources New Relic offers the ability to automatically stream your data from New Relic agents (APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure) and 3rd party instrumentation (Prometheus, DropWizard, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, Fluentd, and more!) for deeper analysis, segmentation, and filtering. Leverage your New Relic data You're already receiving the raw data that powers the out-of-the-box views you see in our products. You can customize and create dashboards and visualizations to focus in on the data you want to see, and answer your key questions about application performance and customer experience—all in real-time. APM: Transactions By default, New Relic APM agents send transactions, transaction errors, and spans to New Relic Database. Transaction events includes information about your app, database calls, the duration of the transaction, and any errors that may occur. Transaction errors occur when a request throws an exception in the code's path that was taken to fill a request. New Relic agents and 3rd party instrumentation create spans when an individual unit of work is done in a distributed system. You can also add custom attributes to existing events or add custom events using the language agent APIs. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticCheck Every time a synthetic check is run off a given monitor, we track a SyntheticCheck request. For every Synthetics monitor you have, you can sort your analysis for the most common errors and most frequent error messages, pinpointing issues in your application. Learn more. Synthetics: SyntheticRequest We create a SyntheticRequest event when we receive a response from your web application for a check we run. Analyze application activity by response code, determine which third party services are slowing your website down, and uncover the content taking up the majority of your page load time. Learn more. Browser: PageView A PageView event is recorded when your web application has a page load and the New Relic Browser agent fires. Analyze detailed statistics on browser type and version usage for your customers, understand how different geographic regions are performing, and create detailed user journeys based on the PageViews from a single session. Learn more. Mobile: MobileSession A MobileSession event begins when any user starts your app. Understand how users are adopting your application and the key screens that they spend time on. Learn which devices and models your team needs to support. Track core mobile KPIs on user activity and engagement. Learn more. Open instrumentation: Metrics, Traces, and Logs New Relic’s open platform allows you to send virtually any telemetry data from in-house, open source, and vendor-agnostic tools to display that information alongside all the other systems and services data you’re managing. Use pre-built exporters and our telemetry SDKs to send metrics from Prometheus, DropWizard, and Micrometer (and more), traces using Zipkin, and logs from Fluentd, fluentbit, and other open source tools. Or send other telemetry data directly to our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API. Add your own business data Providing customers with the ability to aggregate, filter, segment, and combine unique sets of their New Relic data is just the start. To take your application performance analysis to the next level, it’s critical that you add your own content to your data. In New Relic, you can do that in two ways; by enriching an existing data stream with custom attributes, or by importing data from other data sources. Custom attributes Add important context to your existing data with custom attributes. By adding one line of code to your application, you can track useful information such as customer or account ID. After adding this single attribute, you'll be able to segment your performance data by customer or account, and understand the exact performance, issues, errors, and features that customer is experiencing. Learn more about implementing and leveraging custom attributes. Custom events Import data in JSON format to our Event API, and analyze that data in New Relic. A common example of using the custom events API is to import additional datasets alongside data that New Relic agents capture natively for deeper analysis. While some use cases have centered around tracking infrastructure performance, server metrics, or more detailed user analytics, there are also a variety of customers using custom events and New Relic dashboards as a general toolset for real-time analytics. Some of our customers pull in data from other business and technical systems completely independent of application performance. Custom logs Beyond providing granular log visibility for New Relic sources, customers can also ingest and analyze any text-based data originating on-prem or in the cloud to troubleshoot incidents and reduce the mean time to resolution (MTTR). Data Analysis New Relic dashboards give you a powerful array of capabilities and visualizations for analyzing your data in real-time. The main method of querying data in New Relic is via our SQL-flavored language, New Relic Query Language (NRQL). All of the visualizations, analyses and capabilities below are leveraged via NRQL. For details on how to use these different features, refer to our NRQL documentaiton. Visual Data Explorer Explore your data, visually, with a point, click, and search interface for creating charts and analyses in seconds. Understand the types of data captured within New Relic by sampling individual metrics, events, logs, and traces. Grab the auto-generated NRQL to quickly copy and modify it to take your analysis to the next level. Heatmaps Go beyond histograms and create a heatmap by segmenting your histogram by device, geography, browser, or any other aspect of your data. Basics Visualizations Use out-of-the-box visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and numbers widgets to discover trends in your data. Funnels Determine whether low conversion rates at various stages of your funnel (eg, sign up, checkout, or subscribe) are impacted by different levels of performance. Cohorts Create a cohort analysis for your users, and understand how different sets of users engage with your application based on time of day, month, or year. Segmentation Segment your application data in a variety of ways based on default attributes or attributes you add. Histograms Track a performance histogram of any duration metric for a given transaction, pageview, or group of application activity. Filters and linking Create powerful filters that can be applied to any dashboard. You can also use this feature to link multiple dashboards together, creating drill down reports for non-technical users. Data Presentation Whether you need to present a variety of metrics and visualizations in a meeting or on the go, embed charts into your own application, or create self-service dashboards for other teams. Dashboards Dashboards are the most common method of sharing important data stored in New Relic, giving you a simple way to create purpose-specific reports that can be shared in meetings or a heads-up display on a monitor. Whether providing customer support with the ability to understand customer activity around an error or crash, or giving the product team a simple way to understand engagement with top features, dashboards provide a simple, yet powerful, way to share the wealth of data accessible within New Relic. Learn more. Embedded Charts For a real-time view of your telemetry data within your own internal- or customer-facing reporting solutions, New Relic allows you to embed any data widget. And your queries will continue to run and load data in real-time, keeping data consumers up-to-date. Learn more. Mobile App New Relic's mobile app allows you to access any of your dashboards and reports on the go. Our beautiful visualizations are accessible at any time, when you need them, or if you just want to show off your killer metrics. Download New Relic for your iPhone.

      "body": "Serve, publish, and deploy your New Relic One app 30 min When you build a New Relic One app, chances are you'll want to share it with others in your organization. You might even want to share it broadly through our open source channel. But first, you probably want to try it out locally to make sure it's working properly. From the New Relic One Apps page, you can review available apps and subscribe to the ones you want for accounts you manage. The Your apps section shows launchers for New Relic apps, as well as any third-party apps that you subscribe to. The New Relic One catalog provides apps that you haven't subscribed to, some developed by New Relic engineers to provide visualizations we think you'll want, like Cloud Optimizer, which analyzes your cloud environment, or PageView Map, which uses Browser events to chart performance across geographies. Your apps in the catalog are created by third-party contributors and are submitted via opensource.newrelic.com. All are intended to help you visualize the data you need, the way you want it. Here, you learn to: Serve your app locally Add images and metadata to your app Publish it Subscribe and unsubscribe accounts you manage to the app Handle duplicate applications Before you begin This guide requires the following: A New Relic One app or Nerdpack New Relic One CLI A Nerdpack manager role for publishing, deploying, and subscribing apps. Serve your app locally You can locally serve the app you create to New Relic One to test it out. Step 1 of 1 In the parent root folder of your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:serve. Go to one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The ?nerdpacks=local URL suffix will load any locally served Nerdpacks that are available. When you make a change to a locally served Nerdpack, New Relic One will automatically reload it. Add images and metadata to your apps Application creators can include a description of what their apps do and how they're best used when they build an app. They can also include screenshots, icons, and metadata that help to make them easy to spot amongst other applications. Some metadata is added automatically when an app is published: Related entities, listed if there are any. Origin label to indicate where the app comes from: local, custom, or public. The New Relic One CLI enables you to provide the information and images you want to include with your application. Then it's a matter of kicking off a catalog command that validates the information and saves it to the catalog. Step 1 of 3 Update the New Relic One CLI to ensure you're working with the latest version. nr1 update Copy Step 2 of 3 Add catalog metadata and screenshots. Run nr1 create and then select catalog to add a catalog folder to your New Relic One project. The folder contains the following empty files and folder. Add the information as described in the following sections for the process to succeed. screenshots folder A directory that must contain no more than 6 images and meet these criteria: 3:2 aspect ratio PNG format landscape orientation 1600 to 2400 pixels wide documentation.md A markdown file that presents usage information pulled into the Documentation tab for the application in the catalog. additionalInfo.md An optional markdown file for any additional information about using your application. config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application. Must not exceed 30 characters. repository: The URL to the GitHub repo for the application. Must not exceed 1000 characters. details: Describes the purpose of the application and how to use it. Information must not exceed 1000. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include any markdown or HTML. support: An object that contains: issues: A valid URL to the GitHub repository's issues list, generally the GitHub Issues tab for the repo. email: A valid email address for the team supporting the application. community: URL to a support thread, forum, or website for troubleshooting and usage support. whatsNew: A bulleted list of changes in this version. Must not exceed 500 characters. Use carriage returns for formatting. Do not include markdown or HTML. Example: { \"tagline\": \"Map your workloads &amp; entities\", \"repository\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops.git\", \"details\": \"Describe, consume, and manage Workloads and Entities in a geographic \\n model that supports location-specific KPI's, custom metadata, drill-down navigation into Entities \\n and Workloads, real-time configuration, and configuration via automation using the newrelic-cli.\", \"support\": { \"issues\": { \"url\": \"https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workload-geoops/issues\" }, \"email\": { \"address\": \"opensource+nr1-workload-geoops@newrelic.com\" }, \"community\": { \"url\": \"https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/workload-geoops-nerdpack/99478\" } }, \"whatsNew\": \"\\n-Feat: Geographic mapping of Workloads and Entities\\n -Feat: Programmatic alerting rollup of underlying Entities\\n -Feat: Custom KPI measurement per location\\n -Feat: Empty-state edit workflow\\n -Feat: JSON file upload format\\n-Feat: Published (in open source docs) guide to automating configuration using the newrelic-cli\" } Copy Step 3 of 3 Save the metadata and screenshots to the catalog. This validates the information you added to the catalog directory against the criteria described in the previous step, and saves it to the catalog. nr1 catalog:submit Copy Publish your app Publishing places your Nerdpack in New Relic One. To publish or deploy, you must be a Nerdpack manager. New Relic One requires that only one version (following semantic versioning) of a Nerdpack can be published at a time. Tip If you know what channel you want to deploy to (as described in the Deploy your app section that follows), you can run nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=STABLE or nr1 nerdpack:publish --channel=BETA. Step 1 of 2 Update the version attribute in the app's package.json file. This follows semantic versioning, and must be updated before you can successfully publish. Step 2 of 2 To publish your Nerdpack, run nr1 nerdpack:publish. Deploy your app Deploying is applying a Nerdpack version to a specific channel (for example, BETA, or STABLE). A channel can only have one Nerdpack version deployed to it at one time. If a channel has an existing Nerdpack associated with it, deploying a new Nerdpack version to that channel will undeploy the previous one. Channels are meant to be an easier way to control application version access than having to be concerned with specific version numbers. Step 1 of 1 To deploy an application, run nr1 nerdpack:deploy. Subscribe or unsubsribe apps Whether you want to subscribe accounts to an app you've created or to apps already available in the catalog, the process is the same. Note that if you subscribe to an app in the catalog, you'll automatically get any updates that are added to the app. To learn about the appropriate permissions for subscribing, see Permissions for managing applications. Step 1 of 2 Subscribe accounts to an application. Select an application you want to add to your New Relic account. Click Add this app. Note that this button says Manage access if the app has already been subscribed to an account you manage. On the Account access page listing the accounts you can subscribe to an application: Select the accounts you want to subscribe the app to. Choose the channel you want to subscribe the app to, Stable or Dev. This can only be Stable for the public apps created by New Relic. Click the update button. Now you and members of the accounts you have subscribed to the app can launch it from New Relic One. Step 2 of 2 Unsubsribe from an application. On the Apps page, open the app you want to unsubscribe. Click Manage access. Clear the check box for any accounts you want to unsubscribe, and then click the update button. The application is no longer listed in the Your apps section of the Apps page, and you have unsubscribed. Handle duplicate applications You might end up with duplicate applications on your New Relic One Apps page. This can happen when you subscribe to the same app using both the CLI and the catalog. Or if you clone an app, modify, and deploy it, but keep the original name. You can manage duplicates with the catalog. Good to know before you start: You need a user role with the ability to manage Nerdpacks for accounts that you want to unsubscribe and undeploy from applications. You can't remove the public apps. When a duplicate application has no accounts subscribed to it, you undeploy it. For applications that have accounts subscribed to them, you unscubscribe and undeploy. The unsubscribe and undeploy process happens in a batch. To remove an account from an application, but ensure that other accounts continue to be subscribed, select the checkbox, Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Step 1 of 1 Remove duplicates. In the New Relic One catalog, click a public application that has one or more duplicates. (You can only manage duplicates from the public version of the application.) On the application information page, select Clean up applications. Review the information about the application that's open, as well as any duplicates. Click Manage app for duplicates you want to remove. If needed, select Resubscribe these accounts to the new application. Click Unsubscribe and undeploy, and agree to the terms and conditions.",

      "body": "Set up your development environment 20 min If you've decided to build a custom app or modify one of our open source apps, you need a few essential tools: The New Relic One command line interface (CLI) An API key, which you get when you download the CLI Depending on what you want to do with your app, you might have some additional setup and configuration. This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin You must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide. Check out our contributors guidelines, which will walk you through the process.",

Our approach is to provide you with an aggregate view and opportunities to dig into more granular data around unique pageviews for troubleshooting performance issues. User Centric Perceived Performance Web performance teams can use more modern metrics than just page load time to benchmark and improve end-user experience for their dynamic pages. Browser helps developers understand how code impacts customers, answering key questions on page performance. Monitor how long users wait for content to display (paint metrics), how long until users can interact with our page (interactivity metrics), and how long until marquee content renders (largest contentful paint). (see blogpost for more) Single Page App Route Changes View Single Page Application route change performance, regardless of what JavaScript framework you use. Powerful low-level instrumentation can even capture interactions beyond the route change that can be customized via API, allowing monitoring tailored to the architecture of your application, such as for custom frameworks. Session Traces Session Traces provide one of the most valuable assets an engineer requires - context. Beyond identifying long load times, and specific errors, Browser Session Traces provide the story that occurred both before and after an error or performance issue. Pivot from AJAX requests and JavaScript errors into a Session Trace and conversely pivot from a Session Trace out to a specific JavaScript error or Network error. Browser Traces Traces are snapshots of one user’s experience, surfaced as an outlier due to a longer than average load time. It provides details around when it took place, a segmented breakdown of where load time was spent, browser type, and the user’s geographic location. This report is excellent when dissecting areas of your application which are performing poorly for specific users. Page Load Time - Segmentation Chart Page load times capture metrics from the moment a user begins a transaction in the browser until the page completes loading. The reports show average page load time broken down into color-coded segments for: Request queuing, application code, network latency, DOM processing, and Page rendering. Page Load Time - Histogram and Percentiles Histograms and percentiles of browser page load times provide a holistic view of the speed of page loads, one that is not focused on averages alone. Histograms and percentiles surface every page load that occurred during a specified time window, providing the ability to drill into outliers that might have been overlooked otherwise. Geographic Reporting Understand how your end users’ experience with your site varies by geographical region. Identify if more CDN’s are required, or if high value customers in specific parts of the world are having a negative experience with your site’s performance. Page-Level AJAX Calls For a specific page, see all the AJAX calls being made as well as the response time, throughput (rpm), total number of calls, error status codes, and average data transfer made for each one. Page View Throughput Throughput is measured in requests per per minute. Throughput metrics help you understand which pages are being called most frequently. Connect Browser with Backend Performance From the Page views report, you can select single page URL and see all of the associated backend APM transactions (if you have the APM Agent installed in your application). Quickly view the total call time, average response time, and call count for any individual backend transaction. You can also dive deeper into a particular transaction and see diagnostics within our APM reports. Browser Performance New Relic's Browser dashboards provide information about your end users' experience based on browser type and version, so you can understand where to focus your time testing and optimizing for performance. Browser Throughput Provides a snapshot of the average number of pageviews received per minute broken down by browser type. Browser Load Time - Segmentation Chart For each type of browser, a segmented view of time spent on request queuing, application code, network latency, DOM processing, and Page rendering. Browser Version Chart Helps you understand which versions of each browser type your customers come from based on throughput. AJAX If your applications use AJAX to update parts of a webpage after the initial page load, our AJAX dashboards will provide you with the level of visibility you need to understand how those requests are performing and ultimately affecting your users’ experience. AJAX Dashboard The main AJAX dashboard surfaces your site’s most resource intensive AJAX requests, filterable by time consumption, response time, throughput, callback time, and data transfer. From here you can drill into a particular call for detailed analysis. Calls by Page View Shows which page views are calling a particular server side controller, with page level detail around throughput, response time, total number of calls, and data transfer. Request Status Codes The status codes reporting indicates the return behavior from an AJAX call. A large number of non-200 status codes may indicate a problem with your AJAX endpoints. Data Transfer Per Request This shows data transfer which is requested and sent. Use this to look for correlations between high callback times and data transfer rates. JavaScript Errors The JavaScript error dashboards help you identify production JavaScript errors impacting your users' experiences and begin pinpointing how to resolve them. JavaScript Error Summary This summary view gives you a high level understanding of the types of JavaScript errors happening, the frequency at which they occur, and the percentage of users affected by the errors. Errors by Browser For each type of error, this chart shows you which browsers are being impacted by the error and the relative contribution it is making to your total error volume. Percentage of Page Views with Errors For each type of error, this chart shows you the percentage of page views affected by it. This allows you to quickly assess the reach and impact a particular error has on your end users. Error Instance Details Error Instance details grabs a snapshot of a single error and captures the stack trace details available from the browser, focusing on the actionable components, down to the line of code. These are metrics are combined with unique browser combinations down to the version level, and unique url. JavaScript diagnostics doesn't get more granular than this. Source Map Support Troubleshoot minified production JavaScript code, with source map support giving you full visibility to where in your code the front-end error is. Intuitive drag-and-drop lets you locate issues in a click, while API integrations work seamlessly with your build pipeline. Best-in-class Customer Experience Monitoring Crash analysis in New Relic Mobile lets you analyze the most impactful crashes and fix them faster. Source map support in New Relic Browser gives you more actionable visibility into front-end JS errors by showing you exactly where in the original source the error occurred, even if your code is minified. Global Features The following features are used throughout New Relic’s product suite to help make our products easier to use and fit seamlessly into your existing workflows. Quickly View App Health New Relic uses color coded status indicators throughout to help you quickly spot performance issues.

Filterable Geography Understand how your end users’ experience with your site varies by geographical region, down to the city level. Identify how a CDN or ASN/ Internet Service Provider is performing in different regions. Security New Relic is committed to helping customers make their applications fast and secure. We take protecting our customers' data seriously, here's an overview of how we do it. U.S. and EU Data Regions Our global data-hosting structure consists of two regions: European Union and United States. You can select your preferred data region during the account setup process, regardless of your physical location. (Note: We do not support migration or aggregation of data across regions.) SOC2 Audited New Relic has successfully completed a SOC 2 audit of processes and controls relevant to security and availability. This audit reviews our security process and controls and provides both ourselves, and more importantly our customers an independent, third-party assurance that we are taking the appropriate steps to protect our systems and our customer’s data. Secure Data Center The infrastructure that runs the New Relic service and stores our customer’s data resides in a Tier III, SSAE-16 certified data center. Customer data is backed up on a regular basis. Continuous Monitoring New Relic employs both internal and third-party services to perform continuous security scanning on both our network and applications to ensure that our applications and servers remain secure. Secure by Default We strongly believe in the concept of “secure by default”. Customers have to explicitly enable settings within New Relic to authorize the sending of sensitive data. We want to make sure that you are not accidentally exposing anything that you don’t want to. Compliance Friendly New Relic can be configured to operate securely in regulated environments such as PCI, HIPAA, or SOX. In addition we are Swiss and EU Privacy Shield certified.

      "body": "Map page views by region in a custom app 30 min New Relic has powerful and flexible tools for building custom apps and populating them with data. This guide shows you how to build a custom app and populate it with page view data using New Relic's Query Language (NRQL - pronounced 'nurkle'). Then you make your data interactive. And last, if you have a little more time and want to install a third-party React library, you can display the page view data you collect on a map of the world. In this guide, you build an app to display page view data in two ways: In a table On a map Please review the Before you begin section to make sure you have everything you need and don't get stuck halfway through. Before you begin In order to get the most out of this guide, you must have: A New Relic developer account, API key, and the command-line tool. If you don't have these yet, see the steps in Setting up your development environment New Relic Browser page view data to populate the app. Without this data, you won't be able to complete this guide. To add your data to a world map in the second half of the guide: npm, which you'll use during this section of the guide to install Leaflet, a third-party JavaScript React library used to build interactive maps. If you're new to React and npm, you can go here to install Node.js and npm. New Relic terminology The following are some terms used in this guide: New Relic application: The finished product where data is rendered in New Relic One. This might look like a series of interactive charts or a map of the world. Nerdpack: New Relic's standard collection of JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and other files that control the functionality and look of your application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Launcher: The button on New Relic One that launches your application. Nerdlets: New Relic React components used to build your application. The three default files are index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss, but you can customize and add your own. Build a custom app with a table chart Step 1 of 8 Query your browser data Use Query builder to write a NRQL query to see your page view data, as follows. On New Relic One, select Query your data (in the top right corner). That puts you in NRQL mode. You'll use NRQL to test your query before dropping the data into your table. Copy and paste this query into a clear query field, and then select Run. FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy If you have PageView data, this query shows a week of average page views broken down by country and limited to a thousand items. The table will be full width and use the \"chart\" class defined in the CSS. If you don't have any results at this point, ensure your query doesn't have any errors. If your query is correct, you might not have the Browser agent installed. Step 2 of 8 Create and serve a new Nerdpack To get started, create a new Nerdpack, and serve it up to New Relic from your local development environment: Create a new Nerdpack for this app: nr1 create --type nerdpack --name pageviews-app Copy Serve the project up to New Relic: cd pageviews-app && nr1 nerdpack:serve Copy Step 3 of 8 Review your app files and view your app locally Navigate to your pageviews-app to see how it's structured. It contains a launcher folder, where you can customize the description and icon that will be displayed on the app's launcher in New Relic One. It also contains nerdlets, which each contain three default files: index.js, nr1.json, and styles.scss. You'll edit some of these files as part of this guide. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Now in your browser, open https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local, and then click Apps to see the pageview-apps Nerdpack that you served up. When you select the launcher, you see a Hello message. Step 4 of 8 Hard code your account ID For the purposes of this exercise and for your convenience, hard code your account ID. In the pageview-app-nerdlet directory, in the index.js file, add this code between the import and export lines. (Read about finding your account ID here). const accountId = [Replace with your account ID]; Copy Step 5 of 8 Import the TableChart component To show your data in a table chart, import the TableChart component from New Relic One. To do so, in index.js, add this code under import React. import { TableChart } from `nr1`; Copy Step 6 of 8 Add a table with a single row To add a table with a single row, in the index.js file, replace this line: return <h1>Hello, pageview-app-nerdlet Nerdlet!</h1>; Copy with this export code: export default class PageViewApp extends React.Component { render() { return ( <div className=\"container\"> <div className=\"row\"></div> </div> ); } } Copy Step 7 of 8 Customize the look of your table (optional) You can use standard CSS to customize the look of your components. In the styles.scss file, add this CSS. Feel free to customize this CSS to your taste. .container { width: 100%; height: 99vh; display: flex; flex-direction: column; .row { margin: 10px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; } .chart { height: 250px; } } Copy Step 8 of 8 Get your data into that table Now that you've got a table, you can drop a TableChart populated with data from the NRQL query you wrote at the very beginning of this guide. Put this code into the row div. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Go to New Relic One and click your app to see your data in the table. (You might need to serve your app to New Relic again.) Congratulations! You made your app! Continue on to make it interactive and show your data on a map. Make your app interactive with a text field Once you confirm that data is getting to New Relic from your app, you can start customizing it and making it interactive. To do this, you add a text field to filter your data. Later, you use a third-party library called Leaflet to show that data on a world map. Step 1 of 3 Import the TextField component Like you did with the TableChart component, you need to import a TextField component from New Relic One. import { TextField } from 'nr1'; Copy Step 2 of 3 Add a row for your text field To add a text field filter above the table, put this code above the TableChart div. The text field will have a default value of \"US\". <div className=\"row\"> <TextField placeholder=\"US\" onChange={(event) => { this.setState({ countryCode: event.target.value }); }} /> </div>; Copy Step 3 of 3 Build the text field object Above the render() function, add a constructor to build the text field object. constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { countryCode: null } } Copy Then, add a constructor to your render() function. Above return, add: const { countryCode } = this.state; Copy Now add countryCode to your table chart query. <TableChart accountId={accountId} query={`FROM PageView SELECT count(*), average(duration) WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${ countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : '' } FACET countryCode, regionCode SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000`} fullWidth className=\"chart\" />; Copy Reload your app to try out the text field. Get your data on a map To create the map, you use npm to install Leaflet. Step 1 of 9 Install Leaflet In your terminal, type: npm install --save leaflet react-leaflet Copy In your nerdlets styles.scss file, import the Leaflet CSS: @import `~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css`; Copy While you're in styles.scss, fix the width and height of your map: .containerMap { width: 100%; z-index: 0; height: 70vh; } Copy Step 2 of 9 Add a webpack config file for Leaflet Add a webpack configuration file .extended-webpackrc.js to the top-level folder in your nerdpack. This supports your use of map tiling information data from Leaflet. module.exports = { module: { rules: [ { test: /\\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/, use: [ { loader: 'file-loader', options: {}, }, { loader: 'url-loader', options: { limit: 25000 }, }, ], }, ], }, }; Copy Step 3 of 9 Import modules from Leaflet In index.js, import modules from Leaflet. import { Map, CircleMarker, TileLayer } from 'react-leaflet'; Copy Step 4 of 9 Import additional modules from New Relic One You need several more modules from New Relic One to make the Leaflet map work well. Import them with this code: import { NerdGraphQuery, Spinner, Button, BlockText } from 'nr1'; Copy NerdGraphQuery lets you make multiple NRQL queries at once and is what will populate the map with data. Spinner adds a loading spinner. Button gives you button components. BlockText give you block text components. Step 5 of 9 Get data for the map Using latitude and longitude with country codes, you can put New Relic data on a map. mapData() { const { countryCode } = this.state; const query = `{ actor { account(id: 1606862) { mapData: nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) as x, average(duration) as y, sum(asnLatitude)/count(*) as lat, sum(asnLongitude)/count(*) as lng FROM PageView FACET regionCode, countryCode WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' ${countryCode ? ` WHERE countryCode like '%${countryCode}%' ` : ''} LIMIT 1000 \") { results nrql } } } }`; return query; }; Copy Step 6 of 9 Customize the map marker colors Above the mapData function, add this code to customize the map marker colors. getMarkerColor(measure, apdexTarget = 1.7) { if (measure <= apdexTarget) { return '#11A600'; } else if (measure >= apdexTarget && measure <= apdexTarget * 4) { return '#FFD966'; } else { return '#BF0016'; } }; Copy Feel free to change the HTML color code values to your taste. In this example, #11A600 is green, #FFD966 is sort of yellow, and #BF0016 is red. Step 7 of 9 Set your map's default center point Set a default center point for your map using latitude and longitude. const defaultMapCenter = [10.5731, -7.5898]; Copy Step 8 of 9 Add a row for your map Between the text field row and the table chart row, insert a new row for the map content using NerdGraphQuery. <div className=\"row\"> <NerdGraphQuery query={this.mapData()}> {({ loading, error, data }) => { if (loading) { return <Spinner fillContainer />; } if (error) { return 'Error'; } const { results } = data.actor.account.mapData; console.debug(results); return 'Hello'; }} </NerdGraphQuery> </div>; Copy Reload your application in New Relic One to test that it works. Step 9 of 9 Replace \"Hello\" with the Leaflet code Replace return \"Hello\"; with: return ( <Map className=\"containerMap\" center={defaultMapCenter} zoom={2} zoomControl> <TileLayer attribution='&amp;copy <a href=\"http://osm.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors' url=\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\" /> {results.map((pt, i) => { const center = [pt.lat, pt.lng]; return ( <CircleMarker key={`circle-${i}`} center={center} color={this.getMarkerColor(pt.y)} radius={Math.log(pt.x) * 3} onClick={() => { alert(JSON.stringify(pt)); }} /> ); })} </Map> ); Copy This code creates a world map centered on the latitude and longitude you chose using OpenStreetMap data and your marker colors.

      "body": "APM reports metric data in the form of metric timeslice data, and you can use NRQL to query and facet this type of data. Why query metric timeslice data? We report metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data we call metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, Mobile, and Browser (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Historically, this type of data couldn't be queried via our query language, NRQL. But now we are converting popular APM metrics from metric timeslice data to more-detailed dimensional metric data, which opens them up for querying via NRQL and via our NerdGraph API. This capability allows you to create powerful, in-depth custom visualizations of these important APM metrics. And this includes being able to query your custom metrics. Where to query? We recommend querying APM metric timeslice data using New Relic One query builder in advanced mode. This experience offers full NRQL functionality, and also gives helpful auto-complete suggestions and feedback on query errors. You can also incorporate NRQL queries in our NerdGraph (GraphQL) API. How to construct a query In APM, some charts have the option to view the NRQL query that generated that chart. This can be a good option for understanding how to query metrics. The NRQL query examined below is slightly modified from the error rate chart on the APM summary page. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') AND (transactionType = 'Web') SINCE 1 day ago TIMESERIES Here is a breakdown of how the parts of this query work: Query segment What does it do? FROM Metric Metric is one of our core data types, and metric timeslice data is stored as this data type. For general tips on querying Metric data, see Metric query examples. SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) This math generates a count of errors out of a total count of transaction metrics. This query uses the converted metric names. Note that you can use other aggregator functions. WHERE (entity.guid = 'AN_ENTITY_GUID') You must specify at least one data source. You can select a single entity's GUID, as shown here, or you can select multiple sources. This query uses entity.guid, but you can also use appId or appName. AND (transactionType = 'Web') Sets the transaction type to web, meaning that background/non-web transactions won't be counted. SINCE 1 day ago Selecting a time range. TIMESERIES This optional clause displays the results in a time-based chart. For general information on NRQL syntax, including FROM, FACET, and TIMESERIES, see Intro to NRQL. For more queries, see Query examples. How metric timeslice data is converted The conversion of original APM metric timeslice metrics into dimensional metrics that are available for querying is an ongoing process and isn't complete. If you don't see a metric you're looking for in this section, see Generic queries. Here are how the original APM metric timeslice metrics are converted into dimensional metrics: Metric timeslice structure Dimensional metric structure APM metric names are represented as single strings of segments separated by forward slashes. For example, the “Datastore/statement/MySQL/users/select” metric represents the time spent in a select database operation on the users table. A single dimensional metric named apm.service.datastore.operation.duration represents the entire group of datastore metrics. This metric has three attributes representing the data values encoded into the metric name, datastoreType, table and operation: datastoreType = ‘MySQL’ table = ‘users’ operation = ‘select’ Some of the APM metrics made available as dimensional metrics: Metric name Description Attributes apm.service.cpu.usertime.utilization Time spent in user-mode code percentage apm.service.datastore.operation.duration Response time for database calls broken out by table operations datastoreType, table, operation apm.service.error.count Summary error count metrics transactionType apm.service.external.host.duration Response time for external calls broken out by external host name external.host apm.service.instance.count Count of the number of agent instances apm.service.memory.physical Process memory in MB apm.service.transaction.apdex Apdex scores per transaction transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.duration Response time per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.error.count Error counts per transaction keyTransactionName, transactionName, transactionType apm.service.transaction.external.duration External call response time by transaction type transactionType Learn how to see all metrics available to you. To understand more about the general structure of metric timeslice data, including some common examples, see Metric timeslice data. Attributes These attributes are available in addition to the metric-specific attributes listed in the APM metrics table above. Name Description appName The name of the application. appId The ID of the application. entity.guid The GUID of the application. host The host of the monitored process. host.bootId The ID of the boot of the host, if available. host.displayName The display_name of the host, if it was set in the agent. instanceName For Java APM agents, host : port metricName The name of the dimensional metric. metricTimesliceName The timeslice name of the legacy metric. Generic queries with the newrelic.timeslice.value metric For metrics that haven't been converted to dimensional metrics, or for your own custom metrics, we have a dimensional metric named newrelic.timeslice.value. We recommend using the dimensional metrics from the table above when possible. When to use newrelic.timeslice.value? Given a metric timeslice name, you can query to see if it has a converted dimensional metric equivalent with this syntax: FROM Metric SELECT uniques(metricName) WHERE metricTimesliceName = 'Datastore/statement/MySQL/test/select' If the only metric name returned is newrelic.timeslice.value, you'll need to query your data using this general approach. Get available metrics To get a list of available metrics for an application, you can use a query like: SELECT uniques(metricTimesliceName) FROM Metric WHERE appName='YOUR_APP_NAME' AND newrelic.timeslice.value IS NOT NULL Facet on a wildcarded metric name segment Some metric timeslice names include attribute values as segments of the metric name. For example, our APM agents report metrics by tracking the duration of external calls using this format: External/{externalHost}/all Here, {externalHost} represents the host name for the outbound network call. Here's an example of a generic newrelic.timeslice.value query of a custom metric that facets on a wildcarded metric segment: FROM Metric SELECT count(newrelic.timeslice.value) WHERE appName = 'MY APP' WITH METRIC_FORMAT 'Custom/Labels/{action}' TIMESERIES FACET action In this query, {action} creates a temporary attribute, action, which is then used by FACET action. You can use any name you want, because it's only an attribute that exists for the duration of the query. You should choose a name that does not conflict with an existing attribute name. Here's another example of a faceted wildcard query: This shows a NRQL query of metric timeslice data that facets the rate of Flask functions by the wildcarded process name. Recommended aggregator functions Recommended NRQL aggregator functions include: apdex average sum count rate uniques Query examples Some examples of querying metric timeslice data: Facet by multiple app names This query uses WHERE… IN to specify two applications and then facet by them: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'Web throughput' WHERE appName IN ('MY_APPLICATION', 'MY_OTHER_APPLICATION') AND (transactionType = 'Web') FACET appName TIMESERIES Throughput-per-minute rate This query displays requests-per-minute chart using the rate function: FROM Metric SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago Facet by host-related attributes This query displays a requests-per-minute chart faceted by host name: FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher requests_per_minute' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 hours ago FACET host LIMIT 20 Instead of using host, you can facet by other host-related attributes, like host.bootId. Query of average duration of a metric This queries the average duration for a metric using average: FROM Metric SELECT average(apm.service.transaction.duration) as 'HttpDispatcher average duration' WHERE appName = 'MY_APPLICATION' AND (transactionType = 'Web') TIMESERIES SINCE 3 days ago For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Browse the Explorers Hub to get help from the community and join in discussions.

      "body": "Explore NerdGraph using the API Explorer 25 min NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL API. It allows you to get all the information you need in a single request. With NerdGraph API Explorer you don't need to know the query format: using the Query Builder you can browse our entire graph and compose queries just by selecting the items you want and filling out their required values. Before you begin Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and log in using your New Relic user ID and password: the NerdGraph API Explorer loads up. Make sure you have a valid New Relic API key. You can create one directly from the NerdGraph API Explorer. Step 1 of 5 Build a query to retrieve your name Time for your first NerdGraph query. Search for your name in the New Relic database: Erase everything in the query editor. Select the following fields in the query explorer in this order: actor, user, name. This GraphQL snippet appears in the editor. { actor { user { name } } } Copy Step 2 of 5 Click the play button to see the result With this query, you're telling NerdGraph to retrieve your name. You're asking for the name field, which is nested within the user field. This refers to the user who owns the API key, which in turn is nested within actor. Click the play button to see the result: It has almost the same shape as the request. All the fields in the Query Builder make up what's called the GraphQL schema, which describes all the available data types and their attributes. To learn more about each field, click the Docs button, or hover over a field in the editor. Step 3 of 5 Add more fields to your query Now you can try adding more fields to your query. The simplest way is clicking the fields in the Query Builder: The API Explorer knows where the attributes should go in the query. In the example, you add the account id and email fields. Once again, running the GraphQL query results in just the data you need, without over or under-fetching data. Notice that the id field has an argument: passing arguments is a powerful way of customizing your NerdGraph queries. Every field and object can contain arguments, so instead of running multiple queries, you just compose the one that you need. { actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } Copy Step 4 of 5 Experiment with mutations In GraphQL, mutations are a way to execute queries with side effects that can alter the data by creating, updating, or deleting objects (Commonly referred to as CRUD operations in REST APIs). Ready for your first mutation? Erase what's in the editor. Scroll down the Query Builder and expand mutation. Select the fields in the following screenshot: In this case, you're trying to add a custom tag to an entity. Notice that the editor complains if you don't select errors: mutations must have a way of telling you how the operation performed in the backend (failed requests result in null responses). Tip Unlike REST, GraphQL APIs like NerdGraph can return partial responses. For example, if you try adding tags to multiple entities, some mutations can fail and others succeed; all is logged in the GraphQL response you get. Step 5 of 5 Try your NerdGraph query in the terminal Let's say that you've built a NerdGraph query you're happy with and you want to test it elsewhere. To capture code-ready queries and mutations: Select the Tools menu. Copy the query as a curl call or as a New Relic CLI command. # curl version curl https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: API_KEY_REDACTED' \\ --data-binary '{\"query\":\"{\\n actor {\\n user {\\n name\\n email\\n }\\n account(id: 12345678)\\n }\\n}\\n\", \"variables\":\"\"}' # New Relic CLI version newrelic nerdgraph query '{ actor { user { name email } account(id: 12345678) } } ' Copy Next steps Now you know the basics of composing and testing NerdGraph queries, but how do you turn them into client or server code? Solutions such as GraphQL Code Generator can help you turn the NerdGraph queries into code for your implementation. Try creating more complex queries by clicking fields and expanding objects in the Query Builder (be careful with mutations though, since they could write data to your account).

Create NRQL alert condition To create a NRQL alert condition: When you start to create a condition, where it prompts you to Select a product, click NRQL. Tips for creating and using a NRQL condition: Topic Tips Condition types NRQL condition types include static, baseline, and outlier. Create a description For some condition types, you can create a Description. Query results Queries must return a number. The condition works by evaluating that returned number against the thresholds you set. Time period As with all alert conditions, NRQL conditions evaluate one single minute at a time. The implicit SINCE ... UNTIL clause specifying which minute to evaluate is controlled by your Evaluation offset setting. Since very recent data may be incomplete, you may want to query data from 3 minutes ago or longer, especially for: Applications that run on multiple hosts. SyntheticCheck data: Timeouts can take 3 minutes, so 5 minutes or more is recommended. Also, if a query will generate intermittent data, consider using the sum of query results option. Condition settings Use the Condition settings to: Configure whether and how open violations are force-closed. Adjust the evaluation offset. Create a concise and descriptive condition name. (NerdGraph API Only) Provide a text description for the condition that will be included in violations and notifications. Troubleshooting procedures Optional: To include your organization's procedures for handling the incident, add the runbook URL to the condition. Limits on conditions See the maximum values. Health status NRQL alert conditions do not affect an entity's health status display. Examples For more information, see: Expected NRQL syntax Examples of NRQL condition queries Alert threshold types When you create a NRQL alert, you can choose from different types of thresholds: NRQL alert threshold types Description Static This is the simplest type of NRQL threshold. It allows you to create a condition based on a NRQL query that returns a numeric value. Optional: Include a FACET clause. Baseline Uses a self-adjusting condition based on the past behavior of the monitored values. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, except you cannot use a FACET clause. Outlier Looks for group behavior and values that are outliers from those groups. Uses the same NRQL query form as the static type, but requires a FACET clause. NRQL alert syntax Here is the basic syntax for creating all NRQL alert conditions. Depending on the threshold type, also include a FACET clause as applicable. SELECT function(attribute) FROM Event WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Clause Notes SELECT function(attribute) Required Supported functions that return numbers include: apdex average count latest max min percentage percentile sum uniqueCount If you use the percentile aggregator in a faceted alert condition with many facets, this may cause the following error to appear: An error occurred while fetching chart data. If you see this error, use average instead. FROM data type Required Only one data type can be targeted. Supported data types: Event Metric (RAW data points will be returned) WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...] Optional Use the WHERE clause to specify a series of one or more conditions. All the operators are supported. FACET attribute Static: Optional Baseline: Not allowed Outlier: Required Including a FACET clause in your NRQL syntax depends on the threshold type: static, baseline, or outlier. Use the FACET clause to separate your results by attribute and alert on each attribute independently. Faceted queries can return a maximum of 5000 values for static conditions and a maximum of 500 values for outlier conditions. If the query returns more than this number of values, the alert condition cannot be created. If you create the condition and the query returns more than this number later, the alert will fail. Sum of query results (limited or intermittent data) Available only for static (basic) threshold types. If a query returns intermittent or limited data, it may be difficult to set a meaningful threshold. Missing or limited data will sometimes generate false positives or false negatives. To avoid this problem when using the static threshold type, you can set the selector to sum of query results. This lets you set the alert on an aggregated sum instead of a value from a single harvest cycle. Up to two hours of the one-minute data checks can be aggregated. The duration you select determines the width of the rolling sum, and the preview chart will update accordingly. Offset the query time window Every minute, we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows. The start time depends on the value you select in the NRQL condition's Advanced settings > Evaluation offset. Example: Using the default time window to evaluate violations With the Evaluation offset at the default setting of three minutes, the NRQL time window applied to your query will be: SINCE 3 minutes ago UNTIL 2 minutes ago If the event type is sourced from an APM language agent and aggregated from many app instances (for example, Transactions, TransactionErrors, etc.), we recommend evaluating data from three minutes ago or longer. An offset of less than 3 minutes will trigger violations sooner, but you might see more false positives and negatives due to data latency. For cloud data, such as AWS integrations, you may need an offset longer than 3 minutes. Check our AWS polling intervals documentation to determine your best setting. NRQL alert threshold examples Here are some common use cases for NRQL alert conditions. These queries will work for static and baseline threshold types. The outlier threshold type will require additional FACET clauses. Alert on specific segments of your data Create constrained alerts that target a specific segment of your data, such as a few key customers or a range of data. Use the WHERE clause to define those conditions. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction WHERE account_id in (91290, 102021, 20230) SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction WHERE name LIKE 'Controller/checkout/%' Alert on Nth percentile of your data Create alerts when an Nth percentile of your data hits a specified threshold; for example, maintaining SLA service levels. Since we evaluate the NRQL query in one-minute time windows, percentiles will be calculated for each minute separately. SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(databaseDuration, 75) FROM Transaction Alert on max, min, avg of your data Create alerts when your data hits a certain maximum, minimum, or average; for example, ensuring that a duration or response time does not pass a certain threshold. SELECT max(duration) FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction Alert on a percentage of your data Create alerts when a proportion of your data goes above or below a certain threshold. SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration > 2) FROM Transaction SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode = '500') FROM Transaction Alert on Apdex with any T-value Create alerts on Apdex, applying your own T-value for certain transactions. For example, get an alert notification when your Apdex for a T-value of 500ms on transactions for production apps goes below 0.8. SELECT apdex(duration, t:0.5) FROM Transaction WHERE appName like '%prod%' Create a description You can define a description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by downstream systems.

      "body": "You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Read on to learn about the New Relic containerized private minion (CPM), a Docker container-based private minion that accepts and executes synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a Scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a Simple Browser or Scripted Browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a Runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and Memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com/charts If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.

For information on high availability integration, see the Prometheus High Availability resource. Set up the integration From the Prometheus remote write setup page, complete these steps. Enter a name for the Prometheus server you’re connecting to and your remote_write URL. The name you enter for the server will create an attribute on your data, and will be the name used to identify which Prometheus server you're connecting to. Add a new remote_write URL to your Prometheus YML file. A good place to add this information is under global_config in the file, at the same indentation level as the global section.

Details: If you are configuring Prometheus to write into different New Relic accounts or sub-accounts you should use a different key on each remote write URL. prometheus_server URL parameter The prometheus_server parameter is a label or attribute used to add to stats that are written to NRDB. You should use this same label when configuring your Grafana data source to limit results to just those from a particular prometheus_server. Troubleshooting the integration If you receive an integration error message from New Relic or error messages in your Prometheus server logs after restarting your Prometheus server, there are several actions you can take to troubleshoot and get data flowing properly. Below are a few tips regarding common issues and error messages. Common errors and issues: Missing or incorrect characters in the remote write URL in the config file (for example the endpoint, license key, or prometheus_server name) or incorrect placement of the information in the file will result in the Prometheus server not starting, remote write not working properly, or errors appearing in Prometheus server logs. 400: bad request error. If no data appears with a bad request error, check your configuration file to confirm that the placement of the remote write information is correct, and that there are no missing or incorrect characters. 413: request entity too large. This means you have sent a request in which one or more fields, or the entire payload, has exceeded our limits. 429: rate limit error. This means you have hit a rate limit on the amount of data being sent at one time (for example cardinality or data points per minute). You can troubleshoot by reducing the amount of Prometheus or general metric data you are sending, or by requesting a rate-limit increase. You can investigate error messages in New Relic by doing either or both of the following: Run a query on the error message using NRQL then look at the Message field in UI to see a description of what went wrong. For example: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' Investigate individual errors in time to see when and where they occur and any simultaneously occurring issues, and perform targeted troubleshooting based on what you find out. For example: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES If you’ve validated that you can send data successfully but are unable to query it, you may be running into other kinds of limits, like the inspected count limit. This may manifest itself as an error message during the integration process that says: Unable to retrieve data for Prometheus data source <name>. Remove the integration To remove the integration, remove the configuration code snippet from your Prometheus YML file and restart the server. When you remove the integration, this stops new data from flowing, but will not purge or remove any historical data.

      "info": "Customize your New Relic containerized private minion (CPM).",
      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (i.e. counter) and an npm hosted modules (i.e. async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/ Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs.

      "body": "Get started with the New Relic CLI 20 min Access the New Relic platform from the comfort of your terminal: you can use the New Relic CLI to manage entity tags, define workloads, record deployment markers, and much more. Our CLI has been designed for automating common tasks in your DevOps workflow. This guide walks you through the essentials of New Relic CLI, from install and configuration to basic usage. Before you begin For this guide you just need: Your New Relic personal API Key, which you can create from the Account settings of your New Relic account An instrumented application in your New Relic account Step 1 of 10 Install the New Relic CLI The New Relic CLI can be downloaded via Homebrew (macOS), Scoop (Windows), and Snapcraft (Linux). You can also download pre-built binaries for all platforms, including .deb and .rpm packages, and our Windows x64 .msi installer. Linux With Snapcraft installed, run: sudo snap install newrelic-cli macOS With Homebrew installed, run: brew install newrelic-cli Windows With Scoop installed, run: scoop bucket add newrelic-cli https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli.git scoop install newrelic-cli Step 2 of 10 Create your New Relic CLI profile Now that you've installed the New Relic CLI, it's time to create your first profile. Profiles contain credentials and settings that you can apply to any CLI command, which is useful when switching between accounts. To create your first CLI profile, run the profiles add command. Note that you need to set the region of your New Relic account: use -r to set either us or eu (this is required). # Create the tutorial account for the US region newrelic profiles add -n tutorial --apiKey YOUR_NEW_RELIC_API_KEY -r YOUR_REGION # Set the profile as defaults newrelic profiles default -n tutorial Copy Step 3 of 10 Get your application details In this example, you are going to add tags to the application you've instrumented with New Relic. Tags are key-value pairs that can help you organize and filter your entities. An entity (for example, an application) can have a maximum of 100 key-value pairs tied to it. Before searching for your application using the New Relic CLI, write down or copy your Account ID and the name of your application in New Relic - you need both to find applications in the New Relic platform. Step 4 of 10 The New Relic CLI can retrieve your application details as a JSON object. To search for your APM application use the apm application search command. If you get an error, check that the account ID and application name you provided are correct. newrelic apm application search --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID --name NAME_OF_YOUR_APP Copy Step 5 of 10 If the account ID is valid, and the application name exists in your account, apm application search yields data similar to this example. When you've successfully searched for your application, look for the guid value. It's a unique identifier for your application. You should copy it or write it down. [ { accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, applicationId: YOUR_APP_ID, domain: 'APM', entityType: 'APM_APPLICATION_ENTITY', guid: 'A_LONG_GUID', name: 'NAME_OF_YOUR_APP', permalink: 'https://one.newrelic.com/redirect/entity/A_LONG_GUID', reporting: true, type: 'APPLICATION', }, ]; Copy Step 6 of 10 Add a simple tag to your application Now that you have the GUID, you can point the New Relic CLI directly at your application. Adding a tag is the simplest way to try out the CLI capabilities (don't worry, tags can be deleted by using entity tags delete). Let's suppose that you want to add an environment tag to your application. Go ahead and add the dev:testing tag⁠ (or any other key-value pair) to your application using the entities tags create command. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag devkit:testing Copy Step 7 of 10 What if you want to add multiple tags? Tag sets come to the rescue! While tags are key-value pairs separated by colons, tag sets are comma separated lists of tags. For example: tag1:value1,tag2:value2 To add multiple tags at once to your application, modify and run the following snippet. newrelic entity tags create --guid YOUR_APP_GUID --tag tag1:test,tag2:test Copy Adding tags is an asynchronous operation: this means it could take a while for the tags to get created. Step 8 of 10 You've created and added some tags to your application, but how do you know they're there? You need to retrieve your application's tags. To retrieve your application's tags, use the entity tags get command. newrelic entity tags get --guid YOUR_APP_GUID All tags associated with your application are retrieved as a JSON array. [ { Key: 'tag1', Values: ['true'], }, { Key: 'tag2', Values: ['test'], }, { Key: 'tag3', Values: ['testing'], }, // ... ]; Copy Step 9 of 10 Bonus step: Create a deployment marker Deployments of applications often go wrong. Deployment markers are labels that, when attached to your application data, help you track deployments and troubleshoot what happened. To create a deployment marker, run the apm deployment create command using the same Application ID from your earlier search. newrelic apm deployment create --applicationId YOUR_APP_ID --revision $(git describe --tags --always) Copy Step 10 of 10 Notice that the JSON response includes the revision and timestamp of the deployment. This workflow could be built into a continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) system to help indicate changes in your application's behavior after deployments. Here is an example. { \"id\": 37075986, \"links\": { \"application\": 204261368 }, \"revision\": \"v1.2.4\", \"timestamp\": \"2020-03-04T15:11:44-08:00\", \"user\": \"Developer Toolkit Test Account\" } Copy Next steps Have a look at all the available commands. For example, you could create a New Relic workflow using workload create If you'd like to engage with other community members, visit our New Relic Explorers Hub page.

You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. For a condition, you can create a custom violation description using this field. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tag.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tag.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tag.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tag.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tag.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tag.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tag.label.department}} Environment: {{tag.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tag.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tag.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tag.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tag.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tag.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tag.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tag.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic One entity explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tag.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tag.label.owning_team}} Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tag formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tag.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tag.cluster}} Please note that tag names cannot include a whitespace. The expanded values can include a whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tag.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tag.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tag.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tag.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tag.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tag.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (e.g. @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @ e.g. !here or !channel For more help Recommendations for learning more: To learn more about NerdGraph, see Introduction to NerdGraph.

You can: Query data to get insights on the performance on your hypervisors, virtual machines, and more. Go from high level views down to the most granular data. vSphere data visualized in a New Relic dashboard: operating systems, status, average CPU and memory consumption, and more. Our integration uses the vSphere API to collect metrics and events generated by all vSphere's components, and forwards the data to our platform via the infrastructure agent. Why it matters With our vSphere integration you can: Instrument and monitor multiple vSphere instances using the same account. Collect data on snapshots, VMs, hosts, resource pools, clusters, and datastores, including tags. Monitor the health of your hypervisors and VMs using our charts and dashboards. Use the data retrieved to monitor key performance and key capacity scaling indicators. Set alerts based on any metrics collected from vCenter. Create workloads to group resources and focus on key data. You can create workloads using data collected via the vSphere integration. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with VMware vSphere 6.5 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Infrastructure agent installed on a host vCenter service account having at least read-only global permissions with the propagate to children option checked​ Install and activate To install the vSphere integration, choose your setup: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-vsphere. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp vsphere-config.yml.sample vsphere-config.yml Edit the vsphere-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-vsphere MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-vsphere/nri-vsphere-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-vsphere-amd64.msi In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp vsphere-config.yml.sample vsphere-config.yml Edit the vsphere-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Tarball installation (advanced) You can also install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. To configure the vSphere integration, you must define the URL of the vSphere API endpoint, and your vSphere username and password. For configuration examples, see the sample configuration files. Some features of the vSphere integration are optional and can be enabled via configuration settings. With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Enable and configure performance metrics (Beta) Performance metrics provide a better understanding of the current status of VMware resources and can be collected in addition to the metrics collected by default;and included in the samples;described at the bottom of the page. All metrics collected are included in the corresponding sample with the perf. prefix attached to the name. For example, net.packetsRx.summation is collected and sent as perf.net.packetsRx.summation. To collect vSphere performance metrics, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_PERF_METRICS environment variable. Data is collected according to the settings in the vsphere-performance.metrics configuration file. You can override the location of the performance metrics config file using PERF_METRIC_FILE environment variable. Notice that the integration follows VMware's data collection levels (1 to 4). When ENABLE_VSPHERE_PERF_METRICS is set, all level 1 metrics are collected. The data collection level of the performance metrics collected can be modified using PERF_LEVEL. Each metric in the config file can be commented out and new ones can be added if needed. Collection of performance data can increase the load in vCenter and the time needed by to collect data. We recommended to only include the metrics you need in the configuration file. To fine-tune data collection, the number of entities and metrics retrieved per request can be modified using BATCH_SIZE_PERF_ENTITIES and BATCH_SIZE_PERF_METRICS. For more information on vSphere performance metrics, see the VMware documentation. Collect vSphere events (Beta) To collect vSphere events, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_EVENTS environment variable. The integration collects events between the current time and the last fetched event for each datacenter. It stores the information regarding the last fetched event in a cache that is updated after each execution. Events are only available if the integration is connected to a vCenter and not directly to an ESXi host. The number of events collected per request can be tuned by modifying EVENTS_PAGE_SIZE, which is set to 100 by default. Events are available in the Events page and can be queried via NRQL as InfrastructureEvent under vSphereEvent. Here is an example of vSphere events data: \"summary\": \"User dcui@127.0.0.1 logged out (login time: Tuesday, 14 July, 2020 08:32:09 AM, number of API invocations: 0, user agent: VMware-client/6.5.0)\", \"vSphereEvent.computeResource\": \"cluster1\", \"vSphereEvent.datacenter\": \"Prod Datacenter\", \"vSphereEvent.date\": \"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 09:03:51 UTC\", \"vSphereEvent.host\": \"192.168.0.230\", \"vSphereEvent.userName\": \"dcui\" Collect snapshots data (Beta) To collect snapshot data, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_SNAPSHOTS environment variable. Snapshot data can be found in VSphereSnapshotVmSample. Collected data covers total and unique space occupied by disk and memory files, snapshot tree, and creation time. You can use this information to create NRQL queries, dashboards, and alerts, since it's linked to the corresponding virtual machine entity. Collect vSphere tags (Beta) To collect vSphere tags, use the ENABLE_VSPHERE_TAGS environment variable. Tags are available as attributes in the corresponding entity sample as label.tagCategory:tagName. If two tags of the same category are assigned to a resource, they are added to a unique attribute separated by a pipe character. For example: label.tagCategory:tagName|tagName2. Tags can be used to run NRQL queries, filter entities in the entity explorer, and to create dashboards and alerts. Filter resources by tags (Beta) Resource filtering allows you to specify which resources you want to monitor by declaring a set of tags that resources must have in order to be monitored. Resources require a match on any (one or more) of the filter tags in order to be included. If none of the resource tags match any of the filter tags, no information about that resource is sent to New Relic. To use filtering resources by tag you need to have the ENABLE_VSPHERE_TAGS environment variable enabled. A tag filter expression is a space-separated list of pairs of strings with the format category=name. For example, to only retrieve resources with a tag category region and include regions us and eu use a filter expression like: region=us region=eu INCLUDE_TAGS: > region=us region=eu To enable resource filtering by tag, edit your integration configuration file and add the option INCLUDE_TAGS with the filter expression you want. Note that datacenter resources acting as the root of the resource tree MUST have tags attached AND match the filter expression in order for other child resources to be fetched. If you connect the integration directly to the ESXi host, vCenter data is not available (for example, events, tags, or datacenter metadata). Example configuration Here are examples of the vSphere integration configuration, including performance metrics: vsphere-config.yml.sample (Linux) vsphere-config-win.yml.sample (Windows) vsphere-performance.metrics (Performance metrics) For more information, see our documentation about the general structure of on-host integration configurations. The configuration option inventory_source is not compatible with this integration. Update your integration On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. View and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create charts and dashboards. vSphere data is attached to these event types: VSphereHostSample VSphereClusterSample VSphereVmSample VSphereDatastoreSample VSphereDatacenterSample VSphereResourcePoolSample VSphereSnapshotVmSample Performance data is enabled and configured separately (see Enable and configure performance metrics). For more on how to view and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The vSphere integration provides metric data attached to the following New Relic events: VSphereHost VSphereVm VSphereDatastore VSphereDatacenter VSphereResourcePool VSphereCluster VSphereSnapshotVm VSphereHost Name Description cpu.totalMHz Sum of the MHz for all the individual cores on the host cpu.coreMHz Speed of the CPU cores cpu.available Amount of free CPU MHz in the host cpu.overallUsage CPU usage across all cores on the host in MHz cpu.percent Percentage of CPU utilization in the host cpu.cores Number of physical CPU cores on the host. Physical CPU cores are the processors contained by a CPU package cpu.threads Number of physical CPU threads on the host disk.totalMiB Total capacity of disks mounted in host, in MiB mem.free Amount of available memory in the host, in MiB mem.usage Amount of used memory in the host, in MiB mem.size Total memory capacity of the host, in MiB vmCount Number of virtual machines in the host hypervisorHostname Name of the host uuid The hardware BIOS identification datacenterName Name of the datacenter related to the host clusterName Name of the cluster related to the host resourcePoolNameList List of names of the resource pools related to the host datastoreNameList List of names of datastores related to the host datacenterLocation Datacenter location networkNameList List of names of networks related to the host overallStatus gray: Status is unknown green: Entity is OK yellow: Entity might have a problem red: Entity definitely has a problem connectionState The host connection state: connected: Connected to the server. For ESX Server, this is the default setting. disconnected: The user has explicitly taken the host down. VirtualCenter does not expect to receive heartbeats from the host. The next time a heartbeat is received, the host is moved to the connected state again and an event is logged. notResponding: VirtualCenter is not receiving heartbeats from the server. The state automatically changes to connected once heartbeats are received again. This state is typically used to trigger an alarm on the host. inMaintenanceMode The flag to indicate whether or not the host is in maintenance mode. This flag is set when the host has entered the maintenance mode. It is not set during the entering phase of maintenance mode. inQuarantineMode The flag to indicate whether or not the host is in quarantine mode. InfraUpdateHa will recommend to set this flag based on the HealthUpdates received by the HealthUpdateProviders configured for the cluster. A host that is reported as degraded will be recommended to enter quarantine mode, while a host that is reported as healthy will be recommended to exit quarantine mode. Execution of these recommended actions will set this flag. Hosts in quarantine mode will be avoided by vSphere DRS as long as the increased consolidation in the cluster does not negatively affect VM performance. powerState The host power state: poweredOff: The host was specifically powered off by the user through VirtualCenter. This state is not a cetain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to power off the host, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off. poweredOn: The host is powered on. A host that is entering standby mode entering is also in this state. standBy: The host was specifically put in standby mode, either explicitly by the user or automatically by DPM. This state is not a certain state, because after VirtualCenter issues the command to put the host in standby state, the host might crash, or kill all the processes but fail to power off. A host that is exiting standby mode s also in this state. unknown: If the host is disconnected or notResponding, we know its power state, so the host is marked as unknown. standbyMode The host’s standby mode. The property is only populated by vCenter server. If queried directly from the ESX host, the property is unset. entering: The host is entering standby mode. exiting: The host is exiting standby mode. in: The host is in standby mode. none: The host is not in standby mode, and it is not in the process of entering or exiting standby mode. cryptoState Encryption state of the host. Valid values are enumerated by the CryptoState type: incapable: The host is not safe for receiving sensitive material. prepared: The host is prepared for receiving sensitive material but does not have a host key set yet. safe: The host is crypto safe and has a host key set. bootTime The time when the host was booted.
